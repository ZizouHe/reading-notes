Summary\n\nMemory efficiency: Not storing any intermediate quantities of the forward pass allows us to train our models with constant memory cost as a function of depth, a major bottleneck of training deep models.\n\nAdaptive computation: Modern ODE solvers provide guarantees about the growth of approximation error, monitor the level of error, and adapt their evaluation strategy on the fly to achieve the requested level of accuracy. This allows the cost of evaluating a model to scale with problem complexity.\n\nParameter efficiency: When the hidden unit dynamics are parameterized as a continuous function of time, the parameters of nearby “layers” are automatically tied together which reduces the number of parameters required on a supervised learning task.\n\nScalable and invertible normalizing flows: the change of variables formula becomes easier to compute therefore it can avoid the single-unit bottleneck of normalizing flows, and can be trained directly by maximum likelihood.\n\n\n2. Feedforward structure\nThis paper introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of a series of discrete hidden layer, as\n\n\\mathbf { h } _ { t + 1 } = \\mathbf { h } _ { t } + f \\left( \\mathbf { h } _ { t } , \\theta _ { t } \\right)\n\nthe deep neural network can be parameterized by a continuous dynamics of hidden units using an ordinary differential equation scheme\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { h } ( t ) } { d t } = f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta )\n\nTherefore, the traditional network can be seen as this function f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ). And the feedforward step can be solved by a black-box differential equation solver.\n3. Backpropogate scheme\nThe backpropogation step is as follows. Consider the loss function,\n\nL \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 1 } \\right) \\right) = L \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 0 } \\right) + \\int _ { t _ { 0 } } ^ { t _ { 1 } } f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) d t \\right) = L \\left( \\operatorname { ODESolve } \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 0 } \\right) , f , t _ { 0 } , t _ { 1 } , \\theta \\right) \\right)\n\nUsing adjoint sensitivity method,\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { a } ( t ) } { d t } = - \\mathbf { a } ( t ) ^ { \\top } \\frac { \\partial f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) } { \\partial \\mathbf { h } }, \\;\\; \\text{where} \\; \\mathbf { a } ( t ) = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf { h } ( t )}\n\nthis can be solved by a ODE solver once we know \\mathbf{h}(t) for any t_0 \\leq t \\leq t_1. This can be done by using a ODE solver of\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { h } ( t ) } { d t } = f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta )\n\nwith initial value \\mathbf{h}(t_1). With the knowledge of \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf { h } ( t )}, the gradient can be obtained by\n\n\\frac { d L } { d \\theta } = - \\int _ { t _ { 1 } } ^ { t _ { 0 } } \\mathbf { a } ( t ) ^ { \\top } \\frac { \\partial f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) } { \\partial \\theta } d t\n\nstill can be done by a ODE solver. All integrals for solving \\mathbf{h}, \\mathbf{a} and \\partial L / \\partial \\theta  can be computed in a single call to an ODE solver, which concatenates the original state, the adjoint, and the other partial derivatives into a single vector. Therefore, each step in the ODE solver, once we get \\mathbf{h}(t), we can therefore obtain \\mathbf{a}(t) and afterwards, the gradient.\n"},"notes/RDN.html":{"url":"notes/RDN.html","title":"Relational Dependency Networks","keywords":"","body":" Relational Dependency Networks1.

Journal of Machine Learning Research, 8(Mar), 653-692.\n\nRelational Machine Learning Library (RMLLib)\n\n\n1. Summary\nModel the data using the idea of relational database and consider the autocorrelation between instances. The learning algorithm is novel, learning the CPDs based on the query that can return local sub-graphs. The learning algorithm can also produce dependency which interprets the relation between attributes. The inference process utilize the Gibbs sampler. However, it does not have the property like Markov network that the product of CPD is indeed the joint distribution, which is a trade-off between theoretical guarantee and cyclical network that describe wider connection between attributes.\n2. Structure of the network\nInstead of consider independent instance case, RDN consider there are dependency (autocorrelation) among instances and therefore construct a whole large graph connected all instances (by connecting their attributes).\nThe relational data set is represented as a typed, attributed data graph G_D = (V_D,E_D). Consider the data graph in Figure 1(a). The nodes V_D represent objects in the data (e.g.,\nauthors, papers) and the edges E_D represent relations among the objects (e.g., author-of, cites). Each node v_i \\in V_D and edge e_j \\in E_D is associated with a type, T(v_i) = t_{v_i} and T(e_j) = t_{e_j} (e.g., paper, cited-by). Each item type t \\in T has a number of associated attributes \\boldsymbol{X}^t = (X^1_t , ..., X_m^t) (e.g., topic, year). Consequently, each object v_i and link e_j is associated with a set of attribute values\ndetermined by their type, \\boldsymbol{X}_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}} = (X_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}1} , \\ldots, X_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}m}) and \\boldsymbol{X}_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}} = (X_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}1} , \\ldots, X_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}m'}). A PRM represents a joint distribution over the values of the attributes in the data graph,\n\n\\boldsymbol{x}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}}^{\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}}}:v_{i} \\in V \\text{ s.t. }T(v_{i})=t_{v_{i}}\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\boldsymbol{e}_{j}}^{\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\boldsymbol{e}_{\\boldsymbol{j}}}}:e_{j} \\in E \\text{ s.t. } T(e_{j})=t_{e_{j}} \\right\\}\n\nFigure 1. Example (a) data graph and (b) model graph.\nThe network is represented by the product of conditional probability distributions (CPD) of one node given its parents. There are a few things need to be clarified:\n\nSince RDN is a cyclical graph, the product of CPD does not necessarily be the joint distribution, but under some conditions, it is quite close to the joint one.\n\nIn practice, the parents of one node is not given exhaustedly, moreover, we use query from relational database to return a local network for each node and condition on them.\n\nMany machine learning algorithms can reveal the dependency of the variables, i.e. from the local network queried, to select the nodes that are parents of one node.\n\n\n2.1. RDN learning\nThe pseudo-likelihood for data graph G_D is computed as a product over the item types t, the attributes of that type X_t, and the items of that type v,e:\n\nPL\\left(G_{D} ; \\theta\\right) = \\prod_{t \\in T} \\prod_{X_{i}^{t}\\in \\mathbf{X}^{t}}\\prod_{v:T(v)=t} p\\left(x_{v_i}^{t} | pa_{x_{v_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\\prod_{e:T(e)=t}p\\left(x_{e_i}^{t}|pa_{x_{e_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\n\nhere \\theta may not be an explicit set of parameters, but implicit structure like tree. Therefore, we can maximize CPD for every node to maximize pseudo-likelihood:\n\n\\prod_{v:T(v)=t} p\\left(x_{v_i}^{t} | pa_{x_{v_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right) \\; \\text{and} \\; \\prod_{e:T(e)=t}p\\left(x_{e_i}^{t}|pa_{x_{e_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\n\nusing some learners like Relational Bayesian Classifiers as well as Relational Probability Trees. After we maximize the pseudo-likelihood, we also learn the dependency among the nodes, like model graph in Figure 1(b).\n2.2. RDN inference\nFor some unknown nodes, we can use Gibbs sampling to make the inference. We first assign all unknown nodes a prior probability and draw from this prior distribution. Then, for each unknown node, we can randomly draw one sample from its CPD we have learned above. The empirical marginal and joint distribution can be calculated from the samples we draw from the Gibbs sampler.\nFigure 2.

Summary\nThis paper presents a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model with topics as latent variable. The parameter estimation and inference tasks can be made via a combination of variational method and EM algorithm.\n2. Structure\nWe define:\n\nA word is the basic unit of discrete data, defined to be an item from a vocabulary indexed by \\{1, .\\ldots , V \\}. We encode words with one-hot coding.\nA document is a sequence of N words denoted by \\mathbf{w} = (w_1,w_2, \\ldots ,w_N), where w_n is the nth word in the sequence.\nA corpus is a collection of M documents denoted by \\mathbf{D} = \\{\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2, \\ldots , \\mathbf{w}_M\\}.\n\nLDA assumes the following generative process for each document \\mathbf{w} in a corpus \\mathbf{D}:\n\nChoose N \\sim \\operatorname{Poisson}(\\xi).\nChoose \\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Dir}(\\alpha). The dimension of this Dirichlet distribution is assumed known and fixed.\nFor each of the N words w_n:\n (a) Choose a topic z_{n} \\sim \\text { Multinomial }(\\theta).\n (b) Choose a word w_n from p\\left(w_{n} | z_{n}, \\beta\\right), a multinomial probability conditioned on the topic z_n.\n\nBasically, we allocate the multinomial probability of k latent topics using hyper-parameter \\alpha and then sample each word from the sampled multinomial distribution.\n\nFigure 1: Graphical model representation of LDA. The boxes are \"plates\" representing replicates. The outer plate represents documents, while the inner plate represents the repeated choice of topics and words within a document.\nTherefore, we can obtain the marginal distribution of a document:\n\np(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)=\\int p(\\theta | \\alpha)\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\sum_{z_{n}} p\\left(z_{n} | \\theta\\right) p\\left(w_{n} | z_{n}, \\beta\\right)\\right) d \\theta\n\nThe probability of a corpus given parameter \\alpha, \\beta is\n\np(\\mathbf{D} | \\alpha, \\beta) =\\prod_{d=1}^{M} \\int p\\left(\\theta_{d} | \\alpha\\right)\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{N_{d}} \\sum_{z_{d n}} p\\left(z_{d n} | \\theta_{d}\\right) p\\left(w_{d n} | z_{d n}, \\beta\\right)\\right) d \\theta_{d}\n\n3. Learning and Inference\nThe key inferential problem that we need to solve in order to use LDA is that of computing the posterior distribution of the hidden variables given a document:\n\np(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{w}, \\alpha, \\beta)=\\frac{p(\\theta, \\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)}{p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)}\n\nwhich is intractable because of the intractability of p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta). We consider using a variational inference method to approximate this posterior distribution:\n\nq(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\gamma, \\phi)=q(\\theta | \\gamma) \\prod_{n=1}^{N} q\\left(z_{n} | \\phi_{n}\\right)\n\nAs for the learning task, we wish to find parameters \\alpha and \\beta that maximize the (marginal) log likelihood of the data:\n\n\\ell(\\alpha, \\beta)=\\sum_{d=1}^{M} \\log p\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{d} | \\alpha, \\beta\\right)\n\nsince p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta) is intractable, We can thus find approximate empirical Bayes estimates for the LDA model via an alternating variational EM procedure that maximizes a lower bound with respect to the variational parameters \\gamma and \\phi, and then, for fixed values of the variational parameters, maximizes the lower bound with respect to the model parameters \\alpha and \\beta:\n\n(E-step) For each document, find the optimizing values of the variational parameters \\left\\{\\gamma_{d}^{*}, \\phi_{d}^{*} :d \\in \\mathbf{D} \\right\\}. This minimization can be achieved via an iterative fixed-point method.\n\n\n\\left(\\gamma^{*}, \\phi^{*}\\right)=\\arg \\min _{(\\gamma, \\phi)} \\mathrm{D}(q(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\gamma, \\phi) \\| p(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{w}, \\alpha, \\beta))\n\n\n(M-step) Maximize the resulting lower bound on the log likelihood with respect to the model parameters \\alpha and \\beta.

The upper bound is shown using a novel technique for distribution learning based on a notion of compression. Any class of distributions that allows such a compression scheme can also be learned with few samples. Furthermore, if a class of distributions has such a compression scheme, then so do the classes of products and mixtures of those distributions.\n2. Definition\nDefinition.

We say \\mathcal{F} admits (\\tau, t, m) r-robust compression if there exists a decoder \\mathcal{J} for \\mathcal{F} such that for any distribution g \\in \\mathcal{F}, and for any distribution q on Z with \\|g-q\\|_{1} \\leq r, the following holds:\nFor any \\varepsilon \\in(0,1), if a sample S is drawn from q^{m(\\varepsilon) \\log 1 / \\delta}, then with probability at least 1 - \\delta, there exists a sequence L of at most \\tau(\\varepsilon) elements of S, and a sequence B of at most t(\\varepsilon) bits, such that \\|\\mathcal{J}(L, B)-g\\|_{1} \\leq \\varepsilon\nNote that here q can be seen as a corrupted version of real distribution g, and the data is drawn from this corrupted one. And here L and B are sequences therefore can contain repeated elements. Essentially, the definition asserts that with probability 2/3, there is a (short) sequence of elements S and some (small number of) additional bits, from which g can be approximately reconstructed.\nTheorem. There exists a deterministic algorithm that, given candidate distributions f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{M}, a parameter \\varepsilon>0 and \\log \\left(3 M^{2} / \\delta\\right) / 2 \\varepsilon^{2} i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution g, outputs an index j \\in[M] such that\n\n\\left\\|f_{j}-g\\right\\|_{1} \\leq 3 \\min _{i \\in[M]}\\left\\|f_{i}-g\\right\\|_{1}+4 \\varepsilon\n\nwith probability at least 1-\\delta/3.\nNotice that although one decoder cannot know the real set of L and B, it does know the finite length of L and B as a function of \\epsilon.

In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 2917-2925).\n\nFor an introduction to MCMC, see my notes/Monte Carlo Sampling.\n\n\n1. Summary\nIn this paper, a complete framework to direct the MCMC samplers has been presented. It shows that this framework is sufficient and necessary for all MCMC samplers. As many recent work try to use stochastic gradient version MCMC samplers as a consideration of computation, this method mainly introduce a systematical way to guide SGMCMC. Based on this framework, a new MCMC sampler called stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC) has also been introduced\n2. A Stochastic Gradient MCMC Framework\nIn general, we can write all continuous Markov processes as the following form stochastic differential equation:\n\r\n\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{z}= f(\\mathbf{z}) \\mathrm{d} t+ \\sqrt{2 \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z})} \\mathrm{d} \\mathrm{W}(t)\r\n\nwhere f(\\mathbf{z}) denotes the deterministic drift and \\mathrm{W}(t) is a d-dimensional Wiener Process, and D(\\mathbf{z}) is a positive semi-definite diffusion matrix. Notice that only some choices of f(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) yields a stationary distribution with the form p^s(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp^{-H(\\mathbf{z})}. Here H(\\mathbf{z}) is related to Hamiltonian MC as well as other MCMC algorithms.\nThis paper proposes to write f(\\mathbf{z}) into the following form:\n\r\n\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{z})=-[\\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z})+\\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z})] \\nabla H(\\mathbf{z})+\\Gamma(\\mathbf{z}), \\quad \\mathrm{P}_{i}(\\mathbf{z})=\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{z}_{j}}\\left(\\mathrm{D}_{i j}(\\mathbf{z})+\\mathrm{Q}_{i j}(\\mathbf{z})\\right)\r\n\nHere \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) is a skew-symmetric curl matrix representing the deterministic traversing effects seen in HMC procedures. In contrast, the diffusion matrix \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) determines the strength of the Wiener-process-driven diffusion. Matrices \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) can be adjusted to attain faster convergence to the posterior distribution.\nIt is stated that if we specifically write f(\\mathbf{z}) into the above form, then the stationary distribution of SDE has the form of p^s(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp^{-H(\\mathbf{z})}. Moreover, if the stationary distribution of SDE uniquely exists, then there exists skew-symmetric curl matrix \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) such that we can write f(\\mathbf{z}) in the SDE to our specified form, and therefore the stationary distribution has our desired form.\n3. Practical Algorithms and Discussions\n3.1. \\varepsilon-discretization Update\nIn practice, we choose a step size of \\varepsilon and update using the following discretized form of SDE:\n\r\n\\mathbf{z}_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\epsilon_{t}\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\mathrm{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\nabla H\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\Gamma\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right]+\\mathcal{N}\\left(0,2 \\epsilon_{t} \\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right)\r\n\nIn the above step, instead of evaluating the gradient using full data, we can use part of the data to do a stochastic-gradient-descent-style update in order to achieve computation efficiency. Although this SG step is unbiased, it does introduce extra noise into the training procedure. It can be shown that this noise is asymptotically normal, and we can partly subtract this noise by\n\r\n\\mathbf{z}_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\epsilon_{t}\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\mathrm{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\nabla \\widetilde{H}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\Gamma\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right]+\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\epsilon_{t}\\left(2 \\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)-\\epsilon_{t} \\hat{\\mathrm{B}}_{t}\\right)\\right)\r\n\nwhere \\widetilde{H}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right) is the down-sampled version of gradient and \\hat{\\mathrm{B}}_{t} is our estimated noise term. It is also true that this SGD-correction training procedure also yields the correct invariant distribution.\n3.2. Construct Samplers with Proposed Framework\nThe authors shows that all previous MCMC methods, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC), Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) as well as Stochastic Gradient Riemannian Langevin Dynamics (SGRLD) are all adapted to this framework.\nSince the matrices \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) can be adjusted, a new sampler called Stochastic Gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC) has been presented which introduces Fisher information metric as a way to utilize the geometry information of our targeted distribution.

Sharp minima can generalize for deep nets. In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70 (pp. 1019-1028).\n\n1. Summary\nThis paper criticizes some previous definitions of sharpness (for the local minima of loss function) to be unsuitable under the settings of deep neural networks. However, this phenomenon is because the loss function of deep neural networks typically cannot guarantee the positive definite property of Hessian matrix around local minima and those definitions of sharpness usually require some assumptions include positive definite Hessian and smoothness to guarantee the generalization property.\n2. Proof using Re-parameterization Tricks\nDeep neural network has the issue of over-parameterization. Consider a one-hidden layer network, \\boldsymbol{y} = \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x} \\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}) \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2} with ReLU as activation function \\sigma(\\cdot), a transformation T_\\alpha(\\cdot) on the parameter space (\\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2}) is\n\nT_\\alpha(\\cdot): (\\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2}) \\rightarrow (\\alpha \\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\alpha^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2})\n\nThis transformation can be extended to deeper networks and convolution layer can also be included. For the sharpness defined below,\nDefinition. Given \\varepsilon > 0, a minimum \\theta, and a loss L, we define C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon) as the largest (using inclusion as the partial order over the subsets of \\theta) connected set containing \\theta such that \\forall \\theta^\\prime \\in C(L,\\theta,\\varepsilon), L(\\theta′) . The \\varepsilon-flatness will be defined as the volume of C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon). We will call this measure the volume \\varepsilon-flatness.\nDefinition. Let \\mathcal{B}_2(\\varepsilon,\\theta) be an Euclidean ball centered on a minimum \\theta with radius \\varepsilon. Then, for a non-negative valued loss function L, the \\varepsilon-sharpness will be defined as proportional to\n\n\\frac{\\max _{\\theta^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{2}(\\epsilon, \\theta)}\\left(L\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}\\right)-L(\\theta)\\right)}{1+L(\\theta)} \\approx \\frac{\\left|\\left\\|\\left(\\nabla^{2} L\\right)(\\theta)\\right\\|\\right|_{2} \\epsilon^{2}}{2(1+L(\\theta))}\n\nwe can use re-parameterization trick to get the result that for neural networks defined above, C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon) has infinite volume and \\varepsilon-sharpness can be arbitrarily large or small without changing the generalization power.\nMoreover, for any Hessian-based or Jacobian-based definition, it is not valid to be considered in deep neural networks settings.\n"},"notes/Sharpe_Minima_Exp.html":{"url":"notes/Sharpe_Minima_Exp.html","title":"Large Batch Training and Sharpe Minima","keywords":"","body":" On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima1.

Summary\nThis paper discusses the phenomenon the generalization gap (test error drop) for the large-batch SGD. It states that large-batch SGD training is more likely to converge to the sharp minima while the small-batch SGD converges to the flat minima, which is due to the inherent noise in the training.\n2. Generalization Gap for Large-batch\nEmpirically, large-batch SGD experience a drop in test error and by experiment, we can check that this is not caused by over-fitting. Another explanation could be sharpness, as in the lens of the minimum description length (MDL) theory, which states that statistical models that require fewer bits to describe generalize better. Since flat minima can be specified with lower precision than to sharp minima, they tend to have better generalization performance. Alternative theory of sharpness and generalization are presented through the Bayesian view of learning and the lens of free Gibbs energy.\n3. Sharpness and Explanation\nAs defined in the paper, let\n\n\\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p} :-\\epsilon\\left(\\left|\\left(A^{+} x\\right)_{i}\\right|+1\\right) \\leq z_{i} \\leq \\epsilon\\left(\\left|\\left(A^{+} x\\right)_{i}\\right|+1\\right) \\quad \\forall i \\in\\{1,2, \\cdots, p\\}\\right\\}\n\nwhere A^+ denotes the pseudo-inverse of A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p} and \\epsilon > 0 controls the size of the box. Therefore, we define the \\left(\\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}, A\\right)-sharpness of f at x as:\n\n\\phi_{x, f}(\\epsilon, A) :=\\frac{\\left(\\max _{y \\in \\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}} f(x+A y)\\right)-f(x)}{1+f(x)} \\times 100\n\nUsing the defined sharpness, the local minima found by large-batch method has larger sharpness than that found by small-batch empirically.\nAlthough they are all unbiased gradient estimators, large-batch has small variance which makes it more likely to be stuck in a sharp minima. However, as small-batch introduces much more noise, it has the property of exploration and therefore can avoid the trap of sharp minima. Large-batch methods lack this explorative properties of small-batch methods and tend to zoom-in on the minima closest to the initial point.\nHowever, this definition of sharpness is not very rigorous in a deep neural network setting, as will be shown in Sharp minima can generalize for deep nets.\n"},"notes/RMLHMC.html":{"url":"notes/RMLHMC.html","title":"Riemann Manifold Langevin and HMC","keywords":"","body":" Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods1.

Summary\nThis paper extend two MCMC algorithms: Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo from Euclidean space to Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. This is done by utilizing the geometry information associated with probability density function.\n2. Enlightenment from Metropolis Adjusted Langevin and HMC\n2.1. Metropolis Adjusted Langevin\nBased on a Langevin diffusion, the SDE with stationary distribution p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is\n\r\n\\mathrm{d} \\theta(t)=\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)\\} \\mathrm{d} t / 2+\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{b}(t)\r\n\nwhere \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\equiv \\log \\{p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\} and \\mathbf{b} denotes a D-dimensional Brownian motion. A first-order Euler discretization of the SDE gives the proposal mechanism\n\r\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}+\\varepsilon^{2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}\\right) / 2+\\varepsilon \\mathbf{z}^{n}\r\n\nwhere \\mathbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}) and \\epsilon is the integration step size. Notice that the error this discretization introduces can be corrected by employing a Metropolis acceptance probability after each integration step.\nAlthough the drift term in the proposal mechanism for the Metropolis Adjusted Langevin defines the direction for the proposal based on the gradient information, it is clear that the isotropic diffusion will be inefficient for strongly correlated variables \\boldsymbol{\\theta} with widely differing variances forcing the step size to accommodate the variate with smallest variance. This issue can be circumvented by employing a preconditioning matrix M such that\n\r\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}+\\varepsilon^{2} \\mathbf{M} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}\\right) / 2+\\varepsilon \\sqrt{\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{z}}^{n}\r\n\n2.2. HMC\nWith a auxiliary variable \\boldsymbol{p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{0}, M), we can define the negative joint log-probability as\n\r\nH(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\mathbf{p})=-\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})+\\frac{1}{2} \\log \\left\\{(2 \\pi)^{D}|\\mathbf{M}|\\right\\}+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{p}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{p}\r\n\nwhere the kinetic energy term \\mathbf{p}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{p} / 2 where the covariance matrix \\mathbf{M} denotes a mass matrix.\nIt can be shown that the discrete version of HMC (leapfrog method) is equivalent to a Metropolis Adjusted Langevin with precondition matrix \\mathbf{M}.\n3. Geometry Information in Probability\nA distance metric based on a first order expression for the symmetric Kullback-Liebler divergence between two densities p and q is defined as\n\r\nD_{\\mathcal{S}}(p \\| q)=D(p \\| q)+D(q \\| p)\r\n\nTherefore, up to a small term, we have\n\r\nD_{\\mathcal{S}}(p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}+\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\| p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})) = \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\top} E_{\\mathbf{y} | \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left\\{\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\log p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\log p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})^{\\top}\\right\\} \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\top} \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\r\n\nwhere \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is the Fisher Information matrix.\nThe parameter space of a statistical model is a Riemannian manifold. Therefore\nthe natural geometric structure of the density model p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is defined by the Riemannian manifold and associated metric tensor. Given this geometric structure of the parameter space of statistical models the appropriate adoption of the position specific metric, \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), within an MCMC scheme should yield more effective transitions in the overall algorithm.\n4. Manifold Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm\nGiven the geometric structure for probability models a Langevin diffusion with invariant measure p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) can be defined directly upon the Riemannian manifold with metric tensor \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}):\n\r\nd \\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)=\\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)) d t+d \\tilde{\\mathbf{b}}(t)\r\n\nwhere\n\r\n\\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))=\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)) \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))\r\n\nand\n\r\nd \\tilde{\\mathbf{b}}_{i}(t)=|\\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))|^{-1 / 2} \\sum_{j=1}^{D} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{j}}\\left(\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))_{i j}|\\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))|^{1 / 2}\\right) d t+\\left(\\sqrt{\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))} d \\mathbf{b}(t)\\right)_{i}\r\n\n5.

The shapes of the loss functions near the final solution differ across algorithms, and we trace this back to different algorithms selecting weight vectors with a consistent norm. Switching from one optimization algorithm to another late in training results in a final point characteristic of the second optimization algorithm. \nBatch normalization is key to obtaining this consistency in the projected loss surface.

Summary\nThis paper shows that given a discriminator objective, good semi-supervised learning indeed requires a bad generator, and propose the definition of a preferred generator.\n2. Problem Setups\nGiven a labeled set L = \\{(x, y)\\}, let \\{1, 2, \\cdots , K\\} be the label space for classification. Let D and G denote the discriminator and generator, and P_D and p_G denote the corresponding distributions. Consider the discriminator objective function of GAN-based semi-supervised learning, (this is the standard objective function for GAN-based semi-supervised learning)\n\n\\max _{D} \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{L}} \\log P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K)+\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p} \\log P_{D}(y \\leq K | x)+\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{G}} \\log P_{D}(K+1 | x)\n\nwhere P is the true data distribution. The probability distribution P_D is over K + 1 classes where the first K classes are true classes and the (K + 1)-th class is the fake class. The objective function consists of three terms. The first term is to maximize the log conditional probability for labeled data, which is the standard cost as in supervised learning setting. The second term is to maximize the log probability of the first K classes for unlabeled data. The third term is to maximize the log probability of the (K + 1)-th class for generated data.\nLet f(x) be a nonlinear vector-valued function, and w_k be the weight vector for class k. The discriminator D can be defined as\n\nP_{D}(k | x)=\\frac{\\exp \\left(w_{k}^{\\top} f(x)\\right)}{\\sum_{k^{\\prime}=1}^{K+1} \\exp \\left(w_{k^{\\prime}}^{\\top} f(x)\\right)}\n\nSince this is a form of over-parameterization, w_{K+1} is fixed as a zero vector.\n3. Perfect generator\nTheorem. If the generator distribution p_G matches the truen data distribution p, i.e. p_G = p, and discriminator D has infinite capacity, then for any optimal solution D = (w,f) of the following supervised objective,\n\n\\max _{D} \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{L}} \\log P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K)\n\nthere exists D^* = (w^*, f^*) such that D^* maximizes the semi-supervised cost function and that for all x, P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K) = P_{D^*}(y | x, y \\leq K).\nThis theorem states that given a perfect generator, there is no benefit for introducing the unlabeled data, i.e. the discriminator cannot improved by unsupervised part.\n4. Complement generator\nThe function f maps data points in the input space to the feature space. Let p_k(f) be the density of the data points of class k in the feature space. Given a threshold \\epsilon_k, let F_k be a subset of the data support where p_{k}(f)>\\epsilon_{k}, i.e., F_{k}=\\left\\{f : p_{k}(f)>\\epsilon_{k}\\right\\}. We assume that given \\left\\{\\epsilon_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{K}, the F_k’s are disjoint with a margin.\nSuppose \\cup_{k=1}^{K} F_{k} is bounded by a convex set \\mathcal{B}. If the support F_G of a generator G in the feature space is a relative complement set in \\mathcal{B}, i.e., F_{G}=\\mathcal{B}-\\cup_{k=1}^{K} F_{k}, we call G a complement generator.\nThen the paper states that when G is a complement generator, under mild assumptions, a near- optimal D learns correct decision boundaries in each high-density subset F_k (defined by \\epsilon_k) of the data support in the feature space. Intuitively, the generator generates complement samples so the logits of the true classes are forced to be low in the complement. As a result, the discriminator obtains class boundaries in low-density areas.\n5. Pros and cons of feature matching\nBy matching the first-order moment by SGD, feature matching is performing some kind of distribution matching, though in a rather weak manner. Loosely speaking, feature matching has the effect of generating samples close to the manifold. But due to its weak power in distribution matching, feature matching will inevitably generate samples outside of the manifold, especially when the data complexity increases. Consequently, the generator density p_G is usually lower than the true data density p within the manifold and higher outside. Hence, an optimal discriminator P_{D^*} (K+1 | x)=p(x) /\\left(p(x)+p_{G}(x)\\right) could still distinguish between true and generated samples in many cases.\n"},"notes/Faster_Frank_Wolfe.html":{"url":"notes/Faster_Frank_Wolfe.html","title":"Faster Rates for Frank-Wolfe over Strongly-Convex Sets","keywords":"","body":" Faster Rates for the Frank-Wolfe Method over Strongly-Convex Sets1.

They also show that various balls induced by l_p norms, Schatten norms and group norms are strongly convex on one hand and on the other hand, linear optimization over these sets is straightforward and admits a closed-form solution.\n2. Frank-Wolfe method\nThe Frank-Wolfe method, originally introduced by Frank and Wolfe in the 1950's, is a first order method for the minimization of a smooth convex function over a convex set. Compared to projection method, which is also a first order method on convex set, Frank-Wolfe method is projection free. Its main advantage in large-scale problems is that this projection-free characteristic makes computation efficient. First order and projection-free features enabled the derivation of algorithms that are practical on one hand and come with provable convergence rates on the other.\nFigure 1. Frank-Wolfe Algorithm\nAbove is the general Frank-Wolfe method, where \\mathcal{K} \\subset E is the convex feasible set and \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathcal{K}}(c), c \\in E returns a point x=\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathcal{K}}(c) \\in \\mathcal{K} such that x \\in \\arg \\min _{y \\in \\mathcal{K}} \\langle y, c \\rangle.

Chapter 5 The Efficient Portfolios and CAPM\n1.1. With Risk-free asset\nOptimize allocation factor using Markowitz's mean-variance optimization, which is equivalent to optimize the expected utility under exponential utility. Notice that the risk-free asset here can be used to eliminate the constraint of weights sum to one.\nFor any optimal solutions, they have the same Sharpe ratio, therefore the efficient frontier is a line with slope=optimal Sharpe ratio and intercept the risk-free rate.\nFigure 1. Efficient Frontier with risk-free asset\nIt can be shown that the market portfolio (with market value-weighted allocation vector) is on the efficient frontier and by two fund separation theorem, any efficient portfolio can be decomposed into the market portfolio and the risk-free one.\nCAPM: For the excess return Y of any portfolio, denote Y^m as the excess return of market portfolio, we have\n\nY = \\beta Y^m + \\epsilon, \\; \\; \\beta = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(Y, Y^m)}{\\mathrm{Var}(Y^m)}\n\nand \\epsilon is the external noise.\nThe CAPM model can be validated using\n\nEconometrics: regression and hypothesis testing\nMaximum likelihood estimation with Wald test or likelihood ratio test.\n\n1.2. Without Risk-free asset\nWe need to solve a constraint version of Markowitz's mean-variance optimization problem. It is also not hard using Lagrangian. This time, the efficient frontier is a parabola.\nFigure 2. Efficient Frontier without risk-free asset\nFor any portfolio on the frontier, you can find another one on the frontier that has zero beta with the previous one. The CAPM model is similarly formulated using one portfolio (as market portfolio) and its excess return is compared using its zero-beta counterparts (as risk-free one).\n2. Chapter 6 Factor Pricing Models\n2.1. Multi-factor models\nThe multi-factor model with return \\boldsymbol{R}, factor loading matrix \\boldsymbol{B}, factor \\boldsymbol{f} and external noise \\epsilon,\n\n\\boldsymbol{R} = \\boldsymbol{a} + \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\nThe multi-factor pricing model with expected return \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{R}], risk-free return \\gamma_0,\n\n\\boldsymbol{R} = \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1} + \\boldsymbol{B} (\\boldsymbol{f} - \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1}) + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\; \\; \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1} + \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_k\n\nwhere \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_k = \\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{f}] - \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1} is the excess return of factors. Using multi-factor pricing model, we can estimate the covariance matrix of return \\boldsymbol{R} with fewer parameters:\n\n\\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{R}) = \\boldsymbol{B}\\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{f}) \\boldsymbol{B}^\\top + \\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\n\nNotice that multi-factor model is always valid since this is a statistical decomposition (P245) but multi-factor pricing model needs to be validated.\n2.2. Validate multi-factor pricing model\nIf there is a risk-free asset, the multi-factor pricing model can be formed as\n\n\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\boldsymbol{a} + \\boldsymbol{B} (\\boldsymbol{f} - \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1}) + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\nwhere \\boldsymbol{Y} is the excess return of all asset and the hypothesis test is simply,\n\nH_0: \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = 0\n\nIf there is not a risk-free asset, we need to compare multi-factor model with multi-factor pricing model and the hypothesis test is,\n\nH_0: \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\gamma_0 \\left(\\boldsymbol{1} - \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{1}\\right)\n\nBoth test can be done using a likelihood ratio test where \\boldsymbol{B}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_k (and \\gamma_0 in the risk-free absence case) can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation iteratively if we assume the residual \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} has a normal distribution.\nIf we use macroeconomic factors, whose excess return cannot be observed, we can estimate \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_k using MLE and change the hypothesis test accordingly.\n2.3. PCA and factor analysis\nFor the multi-factor pricing model, if we assume the residual covariance matrix is identity matrix, then it can be shown that the solution of MLE is the same as PCA results. \\boldsymbol{B} and the first K principal component of sample covariance matrix of return \\boldsymbol{R} span the same subspace.\nWhen the portfolio size is large, the PCA and factor analysis are approximately the same. See Fan, Liao and Mincheva (2013).\n3. Chapter 7 Portfolio Allocation and Risk Assessment\n3.1. Risk approximation\nFor any portfolio allocation vector \\boldsymbol{w}, we define the gross exposure c of the portfolio as c = \\| \\boldsymbol{w} \\|_1. Therefore,\n\n\\boldsymbol{w}^+ = \\sum_{w_i \\geq 0} w_i = \\frac{c+1}{2}, \\; \\; \\boldsymbol{w}^- = \\sum_{w_i \nThe variance of this portfolio is\n\nR(\\boldsymbol{w}) = w^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} =  \\boldsymbol{w}, \\; \\; \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{R})\n\nwith estimated covariance matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}, the empirical risk is\n\n\\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w}) = \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w}\n\nFor any portfolio with allocation vector \\boldsymbol{w},\n\n| R(\\boldsymbol{w}) - \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w}) | \\leq e_{\\mathrm{max}} c^2\n\nwhere e_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\max_{i,j} |\\sigma_{ij} - \\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}| = \\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} - \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\|_{\\infty}.\nFan, Liao and Shi (2015) use the concept of high confidence level upper bound (H-CLUB),\n\n\\mathbb{P} \\left[| R(\\boldsymbol{w}) - \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w}) | \\geq \\widehat{U}(\\tau) \\right] \\rightarrow 1 - \\tau, \\; \\; \\tau \\in (0,1)\n\n3.2. Estimation of a large volatility matrix\nExponential Smoothing\nDenote \\mathrm{var}_t(\\boldsymbol{R}_{t+1}) = \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_t the conditional covariance matrix of return on time t+1. The traditional way to estimate is using the return matrix from time t to time 1 and compute the sample covariance matrix as\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_t = \\frac{1}{t} \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \\boldsymbol{R}_{t-i} \\boldsymbol{R}^\\top_{t-i}\n\nIf we consider to localize the data, one naive way is to define a window h \\ll t and\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_t = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} \\boldsymbol{R}_{t-i} \\boldsymbol{R}^\\top_{t-i}\n\nA better way is using Exponential Smoothing method, with a smoothing parameter \\lambda,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_t = (1-\\lambda) \\frac{1}{t} \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \\lambda^i \\boldsymbol{R}_{t-i} \\boldsymbol{R}^\\top_{t-i}\n\nand the estimated volatility matrix can be computed recursively as\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_t = \\lambda \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{t-1} + (1 - \\lambda) \\boldsymbol{R}_{t} \\boldsymbol{R}^\\top_{t}\n\nThresholding regularization\nWhen the portfolio size is large, to deal with the ill-conditioned problem in estimation of volatility matrix, we can use a thresholding method. Given our estimated matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} and a thresholding parameter \\lambda,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\left(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} I\\left(|\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}| \\geq \\lambda\\right)\\right)_{(ij)}\n\nor using a adaptive thresholding estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\left(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} I\\left(|\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} / \\mathrm{SE}(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij})| \\geq \\lambda\\right)\\right)_{(ij)}\n\nwhere \\mathrm{SE}(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}) is the estimated standard error of \\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}.\nProjection onto positive definite matrix space\nTo make our estimated covariance matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda a valid covariance matrix after thresholding, we can use\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^\\top \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\cdots, \\lambda_p) \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}, \\; \\; \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda^+ = \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^\\top \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1^+, \\cdots, \\lambda_p^+) \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\n\nor we can solve a optimization problem, for any symmetric matrix \\boldsymbol{A},\n\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{R}} \\| \\boldsymbol{A} - \\boldsymbol{R} \\|_F^2, \\; \\; \\mathrm{s.t.} \\; \\boldsymbol{R} \\succeq 0, \\mathrm{diag}(\\boldsymbol{R}) = \\boldsymbol{I}_p\n\nHere \\boldsymbol{A} is set to\n\n\\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{-1/2} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda \\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{-1/2}\n\nand for the solution to the optimization problem \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_\\lambda, the corrected covariance matrix is\n\n\\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{1/2} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_\\lambda \\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{1/2}\n\nRegularization by penalized likelihood\nPenalized likelihood is useful to explore the sparsity. Denote l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) be the log-likelihood function, we assume \\boldsymbol{\\theta} is sparse and the penalized likelihood is\n\n\\arg \\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\left\\{-\\frac{2}{T}l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) + \\sum_{i=1}^p p_\\lambda(|\\theta_j|)\\right\\}\n\nwhere p_\\lambda is a penalty function. Usually we set p_\\lambda(|\\theta|) = \\lambda I(\\theta \\neq 0), the L_0 penalty, which results in the best subset selection. However, it is computationally expensive. The LASSO estimator, which uses L_1-penalty, is a convex relaxation but introduces biases due to the shrinkage of LASSO.\nFan and Li (2001) introduced a family of folded-concave penalty functions such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) whose derivative is\n\np_\\lambda^\\prime(t) = \\lambda \\left\\{I(t \\leq \\lambda) + \\frac{(a \\lambda - t)_+}{(a - 1)\\lambda} I(t > \\lambda) \\right\\}\n\nThe penalized likelihood with SCAD as penalty function can be solved by an iterated re-weighted LASSO using a local linear approximation (Zou and Li (2008)). For any estimate at k, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(k)}, the target is\n\nQ_{k+1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = -\\frac{2}{T}l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) + \\sum_{i=1}^p w_{k,j} |\\theta_j| + c\n\nwhere w_{k,j} = p_\\lambda^\\prime\\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right) and\n\nc = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left[p_\\lambda\\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}|\\right)- p_\\lambda^\\prime \\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right) |\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right]\n\nIt can be shown that this algorithm is a majorization-minimization algorithm where the target value is decreasing with respect to sequence \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(k)}.\nEstimate volatility matrix using factor model\nGiven factor model\n\n\\boldsymbol{R} = \\boldsymbol{a} + \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\nWe can run a regression to obtain \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} and the regression residuals \\hat{\\sigma}_1^2, \\cdots, \\hat{\\sigma}_p^2. And we can compute sample covariance matrix \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_f of \\boldsymbol{f}. If we assume noise terms are independent of each other, we have the strict factor model based estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^S = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_f \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^\\top + \\mathrm{diag}(\\hat{\\sigma}_1^2, \\cdots, \\hat{\\sigma}_p^2)\n\nThis estimator has a better rate for estimating \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} and the same rate for estimating \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} compared to the sample covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}.\nIf instead we do not assume the uncorrelatedness of noise term, but explore the sparsity instead. We will have the following approximate factor model estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_f \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^\\top + \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\lambda}^*\n\nwhere \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\lambda}^* is the estimated error covariance matrix applied thresholding on correlation matrix with parameter \\lambda.\nNotice that if \\lambda=1, then \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^S and if \\lambda=0, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A is the sample covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}.\nNow consider the approximate factor model with unobserved factors, we can use Principal Orthogonal complEment Thresholding (POET) by Fan, Liao and Mincheva (2013).\n\nObtain the sample covariance matrix \\boldsymbol{S} based on T returns.\nRun a singular value decomposition: \\boldsymbol{S}=\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{T}.\nCompute the residual covariance matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Q}}=\\sum_{j=K+1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{\\top}.\nRegularize Q to obtain \\widehat{Q}_{\\lambda}, e.g. correlation matrix thresholding.\nCompute the POET estimator as\n\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\lambda}^{P}=\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{T}+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Q}}_{\\lambda}\n\nPOET encompasses many methods, when \\lambda=0, it is sample covariance matrix; when \\lambda=1, it is strict factor model with unknown factors; when K=0, it is thresholded sample covariance matrix.\nHigh-dimensional PCA and factor analysis\nThe factor model\n\n\\boldsymbol{R}_t = \\boldsymbol{a} + (\\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{H}) (\\boldsymbol{H}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{f}_t) + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_t\n\nfor any non-singular matrix \\boldsymbol{H}. Therefore, we can assume \\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{f}_t) = \\boldsymbol{I}_K and columns of \\boldsymbol{B} are orthogonal. Therefore,\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{B}^\\top + \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_\\epsilon\n\nIf the factors are strong (pervasive), then we have asymptotically,\n\n\\sum_{j=K+1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{\\top} \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^K \\boldsymbol{b}_j \\boldsymbol{b}_j^\\top = \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{B}^\\top\n\nand\n\nf_{jt} \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\xi}^\\top_j \\boldsymbol{R}_t / \\lambda_j^{1/2}\n\nwhere \\{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_j\\}, \\{\\lambda_j\\} are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}_t.\n3.3. Portfolio allocation with gross-exposure constraints\nOur previous Markowitz’s mean-variance analysis is usually too sensitive on input vectors and their estimation errors and can result in extreme short positions. This problem is more severe for large portfolio.\nWe consider optimization with gross-exposure constraint:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\min_{\\boldsymbol{w}} R(\\boldsymbol{w}) =  \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w}  \\\\\n\\text{s,t.} \\; \\; &\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c, \\; \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\alpha\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow if we only consider the risk profile not the return. We can define actual and perceived risks:\n\nR(\\boldsymbol{w})=\\boldsymbol{w}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w}, \\quad \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w})=\\boldsymbol{w}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w}\n\nand oracle and empirical allocation vectors\n\n\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}=\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c} R(\\boldsymbol{w}), \\quad \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}=\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c} \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w})\n\nLet e_{\\max}=|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}-\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}. Then, we have,\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\left|R\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)-R\\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq 2 e_{\\max } c^{2}} \\\\ {\\left|R\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)-\\widehat{R}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq e_{\\max } c^{2}} \\\\ {\\left|R\\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}\\right)-\\widehat{R}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq e_{\\max } c^{2}}\\end{array}\n\nNow we show the convergence rate of e_{\\max}=|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}-\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}. If for a sufficiently large x,\n\n\\max _{i, j} P\\left\\{b_{T}\\left|\\sigma_{i j}-\\hat{\\sigma}_{i j}\\right|>x\\right\\}\nfor some positive constants a and C and rate b_{T}, then\n\n|\\Sigma-\\hat{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}=O_{P}\\left(\\frac{(\\log p)^{a}}{b_{T}}\\right)\n\nMoreover, suppose that \\left\\|R_{t}\\right\\|_{\\infty} is bounded and that the returns are weakly dependent in that its \\alpha mixing coefficient \\alpha(q) decays exponentially, namely \\alpha(q)= O\\left(\\exp \\left(-C q^{1 / b}\\right)\\right) for some b. If \\log p=o\\left(n^{1 /(2 b+1)}\\right), then we have the above convergence rate. (See Fan, Zhang and Yu (2012))\nTo better understand why the gross-exposure constraint helps on risk approximation, we make connections with covariance regularization. By the Lagrange multiplier method, our previous risk profile optimization is,\n\n\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w} / 2+\\lambda_{1}\\left(\\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1}-c\\right)+\\lambda_{2}\\left(1-\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\nLet g be the sub-gradient vector of the function \\|w\\|_{1}, whose i^{t h} element is -1, 1 or any values in [-1,1] depending on whether w_{i} is positive, negative or zero, respectively. Then, the first order condition is\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w}+\\lambda_{1} \\boldsymbol{g}-\\lambda_{2} \\mathbf{1}=0} \\\\ {\\lambda_{1}\\left(c-\\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1}\\right)=0, \\quad \\lambda_{1} \\geqslant 0}\\end{array}\n\nin addition to the constraints \\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1 and \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leqslant c. Let \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{w}} be the solution. We can show that it is also the solution to the unconstrained portfolio optimization problem\n\n\\min _{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1} \\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{c} \\boldsymbol{w}\n\nin which, with \\tilde{g} being the gradient evaluated at \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{w}},\n\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{c}=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}+\\lambda_{1}\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{g}} \\mathbf{1}^{\\top}+\\mathbf{1} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{g}}^{\\top}\\right)\n\nWe now show the link between regression and risk profile optimization. Set R_p = Y, X_j = R_j - R_p, we have\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{R})\n&= \\min_b \\mathbb{E} \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{R} - b\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= \\min_b \\mathbb{E} \\left(Y - w_1 X_1 - \\cdots - w_{p-1} X_{p-1} - b\\right)^2 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\nand the constraint on gross-exposure can be replaced by a similar L_1 norm.\n4. Chapter 8 Consumption based CAPM\n4.1. CCAPM\nRepresentative consumer consumes on a representative good with quantity C_{t} and price\np_{t} at time t.

Dynamic Programming\nThe term dynamic programming (DP) refers to a collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the environment as a Markov decision process (MDP). In Dynamic Programming, we know exactly what the model is, that is p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right), \\text { for all } s \\in \\mathcal{S} \\text { and } a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s).\n3.1. Policy Evaluation\n\n3.2. Policy Improvement\nPolicy improvement theorem: Let \\pi and \\pi^{\\prime} be any pair of deterministic policies such that, for all s \\in \\mathcal{S},\n\nq_{\\pi}\\left(s, \\pi^{\\prime}(s)\\right) \\geq v_{\\pi}(s)\n\nthen for all s \\in \\mathcal{S},\n\nv_{\\pi^{\\prime}}(s) \\geq v_{\\pi}(s)\n\nTherefore, the new greedy policy \\pi^\\prime is given by\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi^{\\prime}(s)\n& \\doteq \\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&=\\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\;  S_{t}=s, A_{t}=a\\right] \\\\\n&=\\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\;  s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nIf the new policy \\pi^\\prime is just as good as the old one \\pi, then \\pi^\\prime is the optimal policy (satisfies Bellman optimal equation):\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{\\pi^{\\prime}}(s)\n&=\\max _{a} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\pi^{\\prime}}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\;  S_{t}=s, A_{t}=a\\right] \\\\\n&=\\max _{a} \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v_{\\pi^{\\prime}}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\n3.3. Policy Iteration\nCombine policy evaluation and policy improvement together, we have:\n\n3.4. Value Iteration\nOne drawback to policy iteration is that each of its iterations involves policy evaluation, which may itself be a protracted iterative computation requiring multiple sweeps through the state set.\nWe can consider using policy evaluation where it stops after just one sweep (one update of each state). This algorithm is called value iteration.\n\n4. Monte Carlo Methods\n4.1. Monte Carlo Prediction\n\nIf a model is not available, then it is particularly useful to estimate action values (the values of state–action pairs) rather than state values. With a model (in DP case), state values alone are sufficient to determine a policy; one simply looks ahead one step and chooses whichever action leads to the best combination of reward and next state.\n4.2. Monte Carlo Control\nThe algorithm is similar with DP case. However, we need to ensure all state-action pairs have a chance to be visited.\n\nWe can eliminate the exploring start assumption by using a \\epsilon-soft policy as follows:\n\nIt can be shown that\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{\\pi}\\left(s, \\pi^{\\prime}(s)\\right)\n&=\\sum_{a} \\pi^{\\prime}(a | s) q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+(1-\\varepsilon) \\max _{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&\\geq \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+(1-\\varepsilon) \\sum_{a} \\frac{\\pi(a | s)-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|}}{1-\\varepsilon} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+\\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&= v_{\\pi}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere the greater or equal is because the sum is a weighted average with nonnegative weights summing to 1, and as such it must be less than or equal to the largest number averaged.\nBy the policy improvement theorem \\pi^\\prime is better than \\pi and equality can hold only when both \\pi^\\prime and \\pi are optimal among the \\epsilon-soft policies, that is, when they are better than or equal to all other \\epsilon-soft policies.\n4.3. Off-policy Prediction and Control via Importance Sampling\nA more straightforward approach is to use two policies, one that is learned about and that becomes the optimal policy, and one that is more exploratory and is used to generate behavior. The policy being learned about is called the target policy, and the policy used to generate behavior is called the behavior policy. In this case we say that learning is from data off'' the target policy, and the overall process is termedoff''-policy learning.\nConsider the target policy \\pi and the behavior policy b, under \\pi, the state-action trajectory start from S_t has the probability,\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left\\{A_{t}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}, \\ldots, S_{T} \\; | \\; S_{t}, A_{t: T-1} \\sim \\pi\\right\\}} \\\\ {\\quad=\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right) p\\left(S_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) \\cdots p\\left(S_{T} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}\\right)} \\\\ {\\quad=\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}\\end{array}\n\nthe relative probability of the trajectory under the target and behavior policies is\n\n\\rho_{t: T-1} \\doteq \\frac{\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}{\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}=\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E} \\left[G_t \\; | \\; S_t\\right] = v_b(s), \\; \\; \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t} | S_{t}=s\\right]=v_{\\pi}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTo estimate v_\\pi(s), we simply scale the returns by the ratios and average the results:\n\nV(s) \\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} G_{t}}{|\\mathcal{T}(s)|}, \\; \\text{ or } \\; V(s) \\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} G_{t}}{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1}}\n\nwhere \\mathcal{T}(s) would only include time steps that were first visits to s within their episodes.\nThe incremental implementation of off-policy Monte Carlo evaluation is shown below, where C(S_t, A_t) is the cumulative weights.\n\nThe corresponding off-policy MC control algorithm is as follows.\n\nNotice that \\pi(S_t) is taken as a greedy policy and only when it coincides with the path of policy $b$, the update will continue within a episode. Therefore, \\pi(A_t | S_t) = 1.\n4.4.

Therefore, the variance of importance sampling can be reduced.\nIn the off-policy estimators, each term of the sum in the numerator is itself a sum:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t}\n&=\\rho_{t: T-1}\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere\n\n\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}=\\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t+2} \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t+2} \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right)} \\cdots \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{T-1} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{T-1} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}\\right)} R_{t+1}\n\nWe can show that,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}\\right] &=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: t} R_{t+1}\\right] \\\\\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+k}\\right] &=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: t+k-1} R_{t+k}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThus,\n\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\tilde{G}_{t}\\right]\n\nwhere\n\n\\tilde{G}_{t} = \\rho_{t: t} R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t: t+1} R_{t+2}+\\gamma^{2} \\rho_{t: t+2} R_{t+3}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{T}\n\nand the ordinary/weighted average of returns can be defined accordingly. This method, known as Per-decision Importance Sampling, is useful to reduce the variance of importance sampling.\n5. Temporal-Difference Learning\n5.1.

Sarsa) is\n\nThe convergence properties of the Sarsa algorithm depend on the nature of the policy’s dependence on Q. For example, one could use \\epsilon-greedy policies. Sarsa converges with probability 1 to an optimal policy and action-value function as long as all state–action pairs are visited an infinite number of times and the policy converges in the limit to the greedy policy.\n5.2. Q-learning: Off-policy TD Control\nNotice that in TD(0) algorithm above, the step we take is based on current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t) and the bootstrap method we used to update Q(S_t,A_t) is also based on current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t). We can consider a off-policy control algorithm decouple the update from current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t).\n\nQ\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\max _{a} Q\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\n\nWe may also use expected value instead of maximum one:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\n&\\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[Q\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right]-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&\\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\n5.3. Double-Q Learning\nIn Q-learning the target policy is the greedy policy given the current action values, which is defined with a max, and in Sarsa the policy is often \\epsilon-greedy, which also involves a maximization operation. In these algorithms, a maximum over estimated values is used implicitly as an estimate of the maximum value, which can lead to a significant positive bias.\nWe can consider using two policy together and update one and only one of them each time.\n\n6. n-step Bootstrapping\n6.1. n-step On-policy learning\nThe complete return is\n\nG_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\gamma^{2} R_{t+3}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T}\n\nIn one-step updates the target is the first reward plus the discounted estimated value of the next state, which we call the one-step return:\n\nG_{t: t+1} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma V_{t}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)\n\nSimilarly, we can define n-step return as\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n}+\\gamma^{n} V_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t+n}\\right)\n\nThe n-step return has a better prediction error than one-step return under worst case:\n\n\\max _{s}\\left|\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t: t+n} \\; | \\; S_{t}=s\\right]-v_{\\pi}(s)\\right| \\leq \\gamma^{n} \\max _{s}\\left|V_{t+n-1}(s)-v_{\\pi}(s)\\right|\n\n\nand the n-step Sarsa can be derived similarly.\n\n6.2. n-step Off-policy Learning\nConsider the target policy \\pi and the behavior policy b. Define\n\n\\rho_{t: h} \\doteq \\prod_{k=t}^{\\min (h, T-1)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}\n\nTherefore, the off-policy n-step Sarsa is as follows.\n\n6.3. Per-decision Methods with Control Variates\nFor the n steps ending at horizon h, the n-step return can be written\n\nG_{t: h}=R_{t+1}+\\gamma G_{t+1: h}\n\nwith G_{h: h} \\doteq V_{h-1}\\left(S_{h}\\right). All of the resulting experience, including the first reward R_{t+1} and the next state S_{t+1} must be weighted by the importance sampling ratio for time t, \\rho_{t}=\\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}. If \\rho_t is zero, a simple weighting would result in the n-step return being zero, which could result in high variance when it was used as a target. Instead, consider\n\nG_{t: h} \\doteq \\rho_{t}\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma G_{t+1: h}\\right)+\\left(1-\\rho_{t}\\right) V_{h-1}\\left(S_{t}\\right)\n\nIf \\rho_t is zero, we just use current value to update (which causes no change), and since the expected value of \\rho_t is 1, this above update rule does not change the expected update.\nFor n-step expected Sarsa with the following rule:\n\nQ_{t+n}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\doteq Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha \\rho_{t+1: t+n}\\left[G_{t: t+n}-Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\nwe can write its corresponding control covariate method as\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nG_{t: h}\n&\\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma\\left(\\rho_{t+1} G_{t+1: h}+\\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-\\rho_{t+1} Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t+1}\\left(G_{t+1: h}-Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right)\\right)+\\gamma \\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right), \\quad t\nwhen \\rho_t = 0, we use the off-policy expectation \\bar{V}_{t}(s) \\doteq \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) Q_{t}(s, a) to make the update. And the expectation of \\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-\\rho_{t+1} Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right) is zero.\n6.4. Off-policy Learning Without Importance Sampling: The n-step Tree Backup Algorithm\nWe consider a off-policy without importance sampling. In n-step off-policy Sarsa, we estimate R_{t+j}, 1 \\leq j \\leq n using the reward from another policy b. We now consider estimate this return with expected value over all actions except the action we take.\nThe one-step return (target) is the same as that of Expected Sarsa,\n\nG_{t: t+1} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)\n\nfor t  and the two-step tree-backup return is\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nG_{t: t+2} &\\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma\n \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)\n\\\\ &\\quad \\quad \\quad \\; \\; +\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)\\left(R_{t+2}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+2}, a\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&= R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)+\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) G_{t+1: t+2} \\end{aligned}\n\nThe latter form suggests the general recursive definition of the tree-backup n-step return:\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)+\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) G_{t+1: t+n}\n\nThis can be illustrated from the backup diagram below.\n\nand the n-step tree-backup algorithm for control is:\n\n6.5. A Unifying Algorithm\nConsider unifying the importance sampling with tree-backup algorithm.

Policy Gradient for Continuing Problems Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2)\n1. On-policy Prediction with Approximation\n1.1. Stochastic-gradient and Semi-gradient Methods for On-policy Approximation\nGiven a state distribution \\mu(s) \\geq 0, \\; \\sum \\mu(s) = 1, we obtain a natural objective function, the Mean Squared Value Error, denoted \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}:\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}(\\mathbf{w}) \\doteq \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mu(s)\\left[v_{\\pi}(s)-\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w})\\right]^{2}\n\nUsing stochastic gradient-descent (SGD),\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\n&\\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla\\left[v_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\\right]^{2} \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left[v_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTherefore, the SGD version for Monte Carlo state-value prediction algorithm is as follows.\n\nIf we use bootstrapping estimate of v_\\pi(S_t) such as n-step TD, then this estimate relies on the current weights \\mathbf{w}_{t} and the expression above is biased and will not produce true gradient descent. We call this kind of methods as semi-gradient methods.\n\n1.2. Linear Methods\nDenote \\boldsymbol{x}(s) as the feature vector for state s \\in \\mathcal{S}. Linear methods approximate state-value function by the inner product between \\mathbf{w} and \\mathbf{x}(s):\n\n\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w}) \\doteq \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}(s) \\doteq \\sum_{i=1}^{d} w_{i} x_{i}(s)\n\nThus, in the linear case the general SGD update reduces to a particularly simple form:\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left[U_{t}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\\right] \\mathbf{x}\\left(S_{t}\\right)\n\nThe semi-gradient TD(0) algorithm presented in the previous section also converges under linear function approximation, but this does not follow from general results on SGD; a separate theorem is necessary. The weight vector converged to is also not the global optimum, but rather a point near the local optimum.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\n&\\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}-\\mathbf{w}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t} \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(R_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right) \\end{aligned}\n\nOnce the system has reached steady state, for any given \\mathbf{w}_{t}, the expected next weight vector can be written\n\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\; | \\; \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right]=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\n\nwhere\n\n\\mathbf{b} \\doteq \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathbf{A} \\doteq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right)^{\\top}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n\nif the system converges, it must converge to the weight vector \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{TD}} \\doteq \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{b} which is called the TD fixed point. In fact linear semi-gradient TD(0) converges to this point.\nAt the TD fixed point, it has also been proven (in the continuing case) that the \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}} is within a bounded expansion of the lowest possible error:\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{TD}}\\right) \\leq \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma} \\min _{\\mathbf{w}} \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}(\\mathbf{w})\n\nThe semi-gradient n-step TD algorithm is the natural extension of the tabular n-step TD algorithm presented to semi-gradient function approximation.\n\nwhere the n-step return is generalized as\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n}+\\gamma^{n} \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+n}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq T-n\n\n1.3.

One kind of representation for this case is made up of features corresponding to circles in state space, as shown to the right. If the state is inside a circle, then the corresponding feature has the value 1 and is said to be present; otherwise the feature is 0 and is said to be absent. This kind of 1–0-valued feature is called a binary feature. Given a state, which binary features are present indicate within which circles the state lies, and thus coarsely code for its location. Representing a state with features that overlap in this way (although they need not be circles or binary) is known as coarse coding.\n\nTile Coding\nTile coding is a form of coarse coding for multi-dimensional continuous spaces that is\nflexible and computationally efficient. It may be the most practical feature representation\nfor modern sequential digital computers. In tile coding the receptive fields of the features are grouped into partitions of the state space. Each such partition is called a tiling, and each element of the partition is called a tile.\n\n1.4. Nonlinear Function Approximation: Artificial Neural Networks\n1.5.

Although the identity known as the Sherman-Morrison formula, is superficially complicated, it involves only vector-matrix and vector-vector multiplications and thus is only O\\left(d^{2}\\right). Thus we can store the inverse matrix \\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t}^{-1}\nmaintain it and use it all with only O\\left(d^{2}\\right) memory and per-step computation.

Average Reward: A New Problem Setting for Continuing Tasks\nIn the average-reward setting, the quality of a policy \\pi is defined as the average rate of\nreward, or simply average reward, while following that policy, which we denote as r(\\pi):\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nr(\\pi)\n& \\doteq \\lim _{h \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{t=1}^{h} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t}  \\; | \\; S_{0}, A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right] \\\\\n&=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t} \\; | \\; S_{0}, A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right] \\\\\n&=\\sum_{s} \\mu_{\\pi}(s) \\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\; | \\; s) \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right) r \\end{aligned}\n\nwhere the expectations are conditioned on the initial state, S_{0}, and on the subsequent\nactions, A_{0}, A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{t-1}, being taken according to \\pi. \\mu_{\\pi} is the steady-state distribution, \\mu_{\\pi}(s) \\doteq \\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left\\{S_{t}=s \\; | \\; A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right\\}, which is assumed to exist for any \\pi and to be independent of S_{0}. This assumption about the MDP is known as ergodicity.\nNote that the steady state distribution is the special distribution under which, if you select actions according to \\pi, you remain in the same distribution. That is, for which\n\n\\sum_{s} \\mu_{\\pi}(s) \\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\; | \\; s) p\\left(s^{\\prime} \\; | \\; s, a\\right)=\\mu_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\n\nIn the average-reward setting, returns are defined in terms of differences between rewards and the average reward:\n\nG_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}-r(\\pi)+R_{t+2}-r(\\pi)+R_{t+3}-r(\\pi)+\\cdots\n\nWe simply remove all \\gammas and replace all rewards by the difference between the reward and the true average reward:\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{v_{\\pi}(s)=\\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) \\sum_{r, s^{\\prime}} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right)\\left[r-r(\\pi)+v_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]} \\\\ {q_{\\pi}(s, a)=\\sum_{r, s^{\\prime}} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right)\\left[r-r(\\pi)+\\sum_{a^{\\prime}} \\pi\\left(a^{\\prime} | s^{\\prime}\\right) q_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}, a^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]} \\\\ {v_{*}(s)=\\max _{a} \\sum_{r, s^{\\prime}} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right)\\left[r-\\max _{\\pi} r(\\pi)+v_{*}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]} \\\\ {q_{*}(s, a)=\\sum_{r, s^{\\prime}} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right)\\left[r-\\max _{\\pi} r(\\pi)+\\max _{a^{\\prime}} q_{*}\\left(s^{\\prime}, a^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]}\\end{array}\n\n\n2.3. Differential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa\nWe begin by generalizing the n-step return to its differential form, with function approximation:\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}-\\bar{R}_{t+1}+R_{t+2}-\\bar{R}_{t+2}+\\cdots+R_{t+n}-\\bar{R}_{t+n}+\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right)\n\nwhere \\bar{R} is an estimate of r(\\pi), n \\geq 1. Pseudocode for the complete algorithm is given in the box.\n\nwhere\n\n\\delta_{t} \\doteq G_{t: t+n}-\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\n\n3. Off-policy Methods with Approximation\n3.1. Semi-gradient Methods\nThe one-step, state-value algorithm is semi-gradient off-policy TD(0)\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\n\nwhere \\delta_{t} is defined appropriately depending on whether the problem is episodic and\ndiscounted, or continuing and undiscounted using average reward:\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\delta_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right), \\text { or }} \\\\ {\\delta_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}-\\bar{R}_{t}+\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)}\\end{array}\n\nFor action values, the one-step algorithm is semi-gradient Expected Sarsa:\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+n} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}+\\alpha \\rho_{t+1} \\cdots \\rho_{t+n-1}\\left[G_{t: t+n}-\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right)\n\nwhere\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\delta_{t} & \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a | S_{t+1}\\right) \\hat{q}\\left(S_{t+1}, a, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right), & \\text { or } & \\text { (episodic) } \\\\ \\delta_{t} & \\doteq R_{t+1}-\\bar{R}_{t}+\\sum \\pi\\left(a | S_{t+1}\\right) \\hat{q}\\left(S_{t+1}, a, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right) & & \\text { (continuing) } \\end{aligned}\n\nYou can find the multi-step generalizations of these algorithms in a similar manner.\n3.2. Examples of Off-policy Divergence\nConsider estimating the state-value under the linear parameterization indicated by\nthe expression shown in each state circle. For example, the estimated value of the\nleftmost state is 2 w_{1}+w_{8}, where the subscript corresponds to the component of the overall weight vector \\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{8}; this corresponds to a feature vector for the first state being \\mathbf{x}(1)=(2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)^{\\top}. The reward is zero on all transitions, so the true value function is v_{\\pi}(s)=0, for all s, which can be exactly approximated if \\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{0}. In fact, there are many solutions, as there are more components to the weight vector ( 8) than there are nonterminal states (7). Moreover, the set of feature vectors, \\{\\mathbf{x}(s): s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\}, is a linearly independent set. In all these ways this task seems a favorable case for linear function approximation.\n\nIf we apply semi-gradient TD(0) to this problem, then the weights diverge to infinity. The instability occurs for any positive step size, no matter how small. In fact, it even occurs if an expected update is done as in dynamic programming (DP).\nIf we alter just the distribution of DP updates in Baird’s counterexample, from the uniform distribution to the on-policy distribution (which generally requires asynchronous updating), then convergence is guaranteed. The example shows that even the simplest combination of bootstrapping and function approximation can be unstable if the updates are not done according to the on-policy distribution.\nThere are also counterexamples similar to Baird’s showing divergence for Q-learning.\nOur discussion so far can be summarized by saying that the danger of instability and divergence arises whenever we combine all of the following three elements, making up what we call the deadly triad:\n\nFunction approximation A powerful, scalable way of generalizing from a state space much larger than the memory and computational resources;\n\nBootstrapping Update targets that include existing estimates (as in dynamic programming or TD methods) rather than relying exclusively on actual rewards and complete returns (as in MC methods).\n\nOff-policy training Training on a distribution of transitions other than that produced by the target policy. Sweeping through the state space and updating all states uniformly, as in dynamic programming, does not respect the target policy and is an example of off-policy training.\n\n\n3.3. Linear Value-function Geometry\nWe can define the distance between value functions using the norm\n\n\\|v\\|_{\\mu}^{2} \\doteq \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mu(s) v(s)^{2}\n\nNotice that \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}} we use for semi-gradient method is,\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}(\\mathbf{w}) \\doteq \\sum_{s \\in S} \\mu(s)\\left[v_{\\pi}(s)-\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w})\\right]^{2} = \\left\\|v_{\\mathbf{w}}-v_{\\pi}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2}\n\nWe define a projection operator \\Pi that takes an arbitrary value function to the representable function that is closest in our norm:\n\n\\Pi v \\doteq v_{\\mathrm{w}} \\quad \\text { where } \\quad \\mathrm{w}=\\underset{\\mathrm{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}}{\\arg \\min }\\left\\|v-v_{\\mathrm{w}}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2}\n\nFor a linear function approximator, the projection operation is linear, which implies that it can be represented as an |\\mathcal{S}| \\times |\\mathcal{S}| matrix:\n\n\\Pi \\doteq \\mathbf{X}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D}\n\nwhere \\mathbf{D} is the |\\mathcal{S}| \\times |\\mathcal{S}| matrix with \\mu(s) the diagonal element, and \\mathbf{X} denotes the |\\mathcal{S}| \\times d matrix whose rows are the feature vectors \\mathbf{x}(s)^{\\top}, one for each state s.\nRecall the Bellman equation for value function, we define Bellman error at state s,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}(s)\n& \\doteq\\left(\\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v_{\\mathbf{w}}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\\right)-v_{\\mathbf{w}}(s) \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\mathbf{w}}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-v_{\\mathbf{w}}\\left(S_{t}\\right) \\; | \\; S_{t}=s, A_{t} \\sim \\pi\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTherefore, the Mean Squared Bellman Error is,\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{BE}}(\\mathbf{w})=\\left\\|\\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2}\n\nThe Bellman error vector is a result of applying the Bellman operator B_{\\pi}: \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}|} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}|} to the approximate value function. The Bellman operator is,\n\n\\left(B_{\\pi} v\\right)(s) \\doteq \\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\; | \\; s) \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\n\nThe Bellman error vector for v can be written \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}=B_{\\pi} v_{\\mathbf{w}}-v_{\\mathbf{w}}.\nIf the Bellman operator is applied to a value function in the representable subspace, then, in general, it will produce a new value function that is outside the subspace. In dynamic programming (without function approximation), this operator is applied repeatedly to the points outside the representable space. Eventually that process converges to the true value function v_\\pi, the only fixed point for the Bellman operator.\nWith function approximation, however, the intermediate value functions lying outside the subspace cannot be represented. In this case we are interested in the projection of the Bellman error vector back into the representable space. This is the projected Bellman error vector \\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{v_{\\mathrm{w}}}. Thus, we define the Mean Square Projected Bellman Error,\n\n\\overline{\\operatorname{PBE}}(\\mathbf{w})=\\left\\|\\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2}\n\n3.4. Gradient Descent in the Bellman Error\nThe one-step TD error with discounting is\n\n\\delta_{t}=R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{w}_{t+1} &=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\delta_{t}\\right]^{2}\\right) \\\\ &=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right]^{2}\\right) \\\\ &\\left.=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\alpha \\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right] \\nabla \\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right] \\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\nabla \\delta_{t}\\right] \\\\ &=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left[\\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right)\\right]-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right]\\left[\\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right]\\right] \\end{aligned}\n\nThis update and various ways of sampling it are referred to as the residual-gradient algorithm. If you simply used the sample values in all the expectations, the equation above involves the next state, S_{t+1}, appearing in two expectations that are multiplied together. To get an unbiased sample of the product, two independent samples of the next state are required, but during normal interaction with an external environment only one is obtained. One expectation or the other can be sampled, but not both.\n3.5. The Bellman Error is Not Learnable\nIn reinforcement learning, a hypothesis is said to be ``learnable'' if it can be learned with any amount of experience. It turns out many quantities of apparent interest in reinforcement learning cannot be learned even from an infinite amount of experiential data. These quantities are well defined and can be computed given knowledge of the internal structure of the environment, but cannot be computed or estimated from the observed sequence of feature vectors, actions, and rewards.\nThere are counterexamples where the optimal parameter vector of \\overline{BE} is not a function of the data and thus cannot be learned from it. However, another bootstrapping objective that we have considered, the \\overline{\\mathrm{PBE}}, can be determined from data (are learnable) and determine optimal solution that is in general different from the $\\overline{\\mathrm{BE}}$ minimums.\n3.6. Gradient-TD Methods\nRemember that in the linear case there is always an exact solution, the TD fixed point w_{TD}, at which the \\overline{\\mathrm{PBE}} is zero. This solution could be found by least-squares methods but only by methods of quadratic O\\left(d^{2}\\right) complexity in the number of parameters. We seek instead an SGD method.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\overline{\\operatorname{PBE}}(\\mathbf{w})\n&=\\left\\|\\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2} \\\\\n&=\\left(\\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\\\ &=\\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}^{\\top} \\Pi^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\\\\n&=\\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\\\\n&=\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right)^{\\top}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe gradient with respect to \\mathbf{w} is\n\n\\nabla \\overline{\\mathrm{PBE}}(\\mathbf{w})=2 \\nabla\\left[\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right]^{\\top}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right)\n\nTo turn this into an SGD method, we have to sample something on every time step that has this quantity as its expected value.

It is the solution to a linear\nleast-squares problem that tries to approximate \\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} from the features. The standard SGD method for incrementally finding the vector \\mathbf{v} that minimizes the expected squared\nerror \\left(\\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right)^{2} is known as the Least Mean Square (LMS) rule:\n\n\\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{v}_{t}+\\beta \\rho_{t}\\left(\\delta_{t}-\\mathbf{v}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}\n\nTherefore, the GTD2 algorithm is,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla \\overline{\\operatorname{PBE}}\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha 2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}-\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&\\approx \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbf{v}_{t} \\\\\n& \\approx \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\rho_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nA slightly better algorithm can be derived by doing a few more analytic steps before substituting in \\mathbf{v}_t, which is called GTD(0) algorithm:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right]-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right]\\right) \\\\\n&\\approx \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right]-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right) \\\\\n&\\approx \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\rho_{t}\\left(\\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\n4. Eligibility Traces\n4.1. TD-lambda\nRecall the n-step return,\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n}+\\gamma^{n} \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+n}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq T-n\n\nDefine the \\lambda-return as,\n\nG_{t}^{\\lambda} \\doteq(1-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{n-1} G_{t: t+n}\n\nwe can separate these post-termination terms from the main sum, yielding\n\nG_{t}^{\\lambda}=(1-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^{T-t-1} \\lambda^{n-1} G_{t: t+n}+\\lambda^{T-t-1} G_{t}\n\nas indicated in the figures. This equation makes it clearer what happens when \\lambda=1. In\nthis case the main sum goes to zero, and the remaining term reduces to the conventional return. Thus, for \\lambda=1, updating according to the \\lambda-return is a Monte Carlo algorithm. On the other hand, if \\lambda=0, then the \\lambda-return reduces to G_{t: t+1}, the one-step return.\nWe are now ready to define our first learning algorithm based on the \\lambda-return: the\noffline \\lambda-return algorithm. As an offline algorithm, it makes no changes to the weight vector during the episode. Then, at the end of the episode, a whole sequence of offline\nupdates are made according to our usual semi-gradient rule, using the \\lambda-return as the\ntarget:\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left[G_{t}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right), \\quad t=0, \\ldots, T-1\n\nTD(\\lambda) is one of the oldest and most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning. TD (\\lambda) improves over the offline \\lambda-return algorithm in three ways. First it updates the weight vector on every step of an episode rather than only at the end, and thus its estimates may be better sooner. Second, its computations are equally distributed in time rather than all at the end of the episode. And third, it can be applied to\ncontinuing problems rather than just to episodic problems. In this section we present the\nsemi-gradient version of TD(\\lambda) with function approximation.\nIn \\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda), the eligibility trace vector is initialized to zero at the beginning of the episode, is incremented on each time step by the value gradient, and then fades away by \\gamma \\lambda:\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{z}_{-1} \\doteq \\mathbf{0}} \\\\ {\\mathbf{z}_{t} \\doteq \\gamma \\lambda \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}+\\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq T}\\end{array}\n\nwhere \\gamma is the discount rate and \\lambda is the parameter introduced in the previous section, which we henceforth call the trace-decay parameter. The eligibility trace keeps track of which components of the weight vector have contributed, positively or negatively, to recent state valuations, where \"recent\" is defined in terms of \\gamma \\lambda.\n\nWe also show below the backward or mechanistic view of TD(\\lambda). Each update depends on the current TD error combined with the current eligibility traces of past events.\n\nLinear \\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda) has been proved to converge in the on-policy case if the step-size parameter is reduced over time according to the usual conditions. For the continuing discounted case,\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{\\infty}\\right) \\leq \\frac{1-\\gamma \\lambda}{1-\\gamma} \\min _{\\mathbf{w}} \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}(\\mathbf{w})\n\nIn practice, however, \\lambda=1 is often the poorest choice.\n4.2. Online TD-lambda\nIn general, we define the truncated \\lambda-return for time t, given data only up to some later horizon, h, as\n\nG_{t:h}^{\\lambda} \\doteq(1-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^{h-t-1} \\lambda^{n-1} G_{t: t+n}+\\lambda^{h-t-1} G_{t:h}, \\quad 0 \\leq t\nThe conceptual algorithm involves multiple passes over the episode, one at each horizon, each generating a different sequence of weight vectors. Let us use w_t^h to denote the weights used to generate the value at time t in the sequence up to horizon h. The first weight vector w_0^h in each sequence is that inherited from the previous episode.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nh=1: \\quad &\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{1}+\\alpha\\left[G_{0: 1}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{1}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{1}\\right) \\\\\n \\\\\nh=2: \\quad & \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{2}+\\alpha\\left[G_{0: 2}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{2}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{2} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2}+\\alpha\\left[G_{1: 2}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{1}, \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{1}, \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2}\\right) \\\\\n \\\\\nh=3: \\quad & \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{3}+\\alpha\\left[G_{0: 3}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{3}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{3}\\right) \\\\ & \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3}+\\alpha\\left[G_{1: 3}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{1}, \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{1}, \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3}\\right) \\\\ & \\mathbf{w}_{3}^{3} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3}+\\alpha\\left[G_{2: 3}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{2}, \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{2}, \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe general form for the update is\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}^{h} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{h}+\\alpha\\left[G_{t: h}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{h}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{h}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t\nNow we are ready to introduce the true online TD(\\lambda). The sequence of weight vectors produced by the online \\lambda-return algorithm can be arranged in a triangle:\n\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}{\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{0}} & {} & {} & {} & {} \\\\ {\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{1}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{1}} & {} & {} \\\\ {\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{2}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{2}^{2}} & {} \\\\ {\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{3}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{3}^{3}} & {} \\\\ {} & {\\vdots} & {\\vdots} & {\\vdots} & {\\vdots} & {\\ddots} \\\\ {\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{T}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{T}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{2}^{T}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{3}^{T}} & {\\cdots} & {\\mathbf{w}_{T}^{T}}\\end{array}\n\nOne row of this triangle is produced on each time step. It turns out that the weight\nvectors on the diagonal, the w_t^t, are the only ones really needed. The strategy then is to find a compact, efficient way of computing each w_t^t from the one before. Pseudocode for the complete algorithm is given in the box.\n\nWe can define the action-value method (Sarsa(\\lambda)) similarly.

Stable Off-policy Methods with Traces\nSeveral methods using eligibility traces have been proposed that achieve guarantees of stability under off-policy training, and here we present two of the most important ones.\nGTD(\\lambda) is the eligibility-trace algorithm analogous to GTD(0) the better of the two state-value Gradient-TD prediction algorithms discussed above. Its goal is to learn a parameter \\mathbf{w}_{t} such that \\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w}) \\stackrel{\\vdots}{=} \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}(s) \\approx v_{\\pi}(s), even from data that is due to following another policy b. Its update is\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\delta_{t}^{s} \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\alpha \\gamma\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\n\nwhere\n\n\\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{v}_{t}+\\beta \\delta_{t}^{s} \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\beta\\left(\\mathbf{v}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}\n\nGQ(\\lambda) is the Gradient-TD algorithm for action values with eligibility traces. Its goal is to learn a parameter \\mathbf{w}_{t} such that \\hat{q}\\left(s, a, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right) \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}(s, a) \\approx q_{\\pi}(s, a) from off-policy.

Its most appealing feature is that it is a strict generalization of \\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda) to off-policy learning, meaning that if the behavior policy happens to be the same as the target policy, then \\mathrm{HTD}(\\lambda) becomes the same as \\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda), which is not true for \\mathrm{GTD}(\\lambda). HTD(\\lambda) is defined as\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{w}_{t+1} & \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\delta_{t}^{s} \\mathbf{z}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\mathbf{z}_{t}^{b}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_{t+1} & \\doteq \\mathbf{v}_{t}+\\beta \\delta_{t}^{s} \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\beta\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}^{b} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right), \\quad \\text { with } \\mathbf{v}_{0} \\doteq \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{z}_{t} & \\doteq \\rho_{t}\\left(\\gamma \\lambda \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right), \\quad \\text { with } \\mathbf{z}_{-1} \\doteq \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{z}_{t}^{b} & \\doteq \\gamma \\lambda \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}^{b}+\\mathbf{x}_{t}, \\quad \\text { with } \\mathbf{z}_{-1}^{b} \\doteq \\mathbf{0} \\end{aligned}\n\n5. Policy Gradient Methods\n5.1. Policy Approximation and the Policy Gradient Theorem\nIn this chapter we consider methods for learning the policy parameter based on the gradient of some scalar performance measure J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) with respect to the policy parameter. These methods seek to maximize performance, so their updates stochastic gradient ascent in J is\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha \\widehat{\\nabla J\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}\n\nIn policy gradient methods, the policy can be parameterized in any way, as long as \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is differentiable with respect to its parameters.\nIf the action space is discrete and not too large, then a natural and common kind of parameterization is to form parameterized numerical preferences h(s, a, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\in \\mathbb{R} and the actions with the highest preferences in each state are given the highest probabilities of being selected. For example,\n\n\\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\doteq \\frac{e^{h(s, a, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})}}{\\sum_{b} e^{h(s, b, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})}}\n\nThe action preferences themselves can be parameterized arbitrarily. For example, they\nmight be computed by a deep artificial neural network, where \\boldsymbol{\\theta} is the vector of all the connection weights of the network. Or the preferences could simply be linear in features,\n\nh(s, a, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}(s, a)\n\nIn the episodic case we define performance as\n\nJ(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\doteq v_{\\pi_{\\theta}}\\left(s_{0}\\right)\n\nThere is an excellent theoretical answer to this challenge in the form of the policy gradient theorem, which provides an analytic expression for the gradient of performance with respect to the policy parameter. The policy gradient theorem for the episodic case establishes that\n\n\\nabla J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\propto \\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\nabla \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n\nThe proof of the policy gradient theorem is given below.\n\n5.2. REINFORCE: Monte Carlo Policy Gradient\nNotice that\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n&\\propto \\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\nabla \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}, a\\right) \\nabla \\pi\\left(a | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right) q_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}, a\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(a | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(a | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[q_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t} \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere we introduce A_t and replace a sum over the random variable’s possible values by an expectation under \\pi, and then sampling the expectation.\nUsing this sample to instantiate our generic stochastic gradient ascent algorithm yields the REINFORCE update:\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} \\doteq \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha G_{t} \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}\n\nwhere G_t is obtained by Monte-Carlo sampling.\n\n5.3. REINFORCE with Baseline\nThe policy gradient theorem can be generalized to include a comparison of the action value to an arbitrary baseline b(s):\n\n\\nabla J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\propto \\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a}\\left(q_{\\pi}(s, a)-b(s)\\right) \\nabla \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n\nsince the baseline can be any function, even a random variable, as long as it does not vary with a\n\n\\sum_{a} b(s) \\nabla \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=b(s) \\nabla \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=b(s) \\nabla 1=0\n\nThe policy gradient theorem with baseline can be used to derive an update rule using similar steps as in the previous section. The update rule that we end up with is a new version of REINFORCE that includes a general baseline:\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} \\doteq \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(G_{t}-b\\left(S_{t}\\right)\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}\n\nBecause the baseline could be uniformly zero, this update is a strict generalization of REINFORCE. In general, the baseline leaves the expected value of the update unchanged, but it can have a large effect on its variance. For example, in the bandit algorithms the baseline was just a number (the average of the rewards seen so far), but for MDPs the baseline should vary with state. In some states all actions have high values and we need a high baseline to differentiate the higher valued actions from the less highly valued ones; in other states all actions will have low values and a low baseline is appropriate.\nOne natural choice for the baseline is an estimate of the state value, \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right), where \\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m} is a weight vector learned by one of the methods presented in previous chapters.\n5.4. Actor–Critic Methods\nAlthough the REINFORCE-with-baseline method learns both a policy and a state-value function, we do not consider it to be an actor–critic method because its state-value function is used only as a baseline, not as a critic. That is, it is not used for bootstrapping (updating the value estimate for a state from the estimated values of subsequent states), but only as a baseline for the state whose estimate is being updated. This is a useful distinction, for only through bootstrapping do we introduce bias and an asymptotic dependence on the quality of the function approximation. As we have seen, the bias introduced through bootstrapping and reliance on the state representation is often beneficial because it reduces variance and accelerates learning. REINFORCE with baseline is unbiased and will converge asymptotically to a local minimum, but like all Monte Carlo methods it tends to learn slowly (produce estimates of high variance) and to be inconvenient to implement online or for continuing problems. As we have seen earlier in this book, with temporal-difference methods we can eliminate these inconveniences, and through multi-step methods we can flexibly choose the degree of bootstrapping. In order to gain these advantages in the case of policy gradient methods we use actor–critic methods with a bootstrapping critic.\nFirst consider one-step actor–critic methods. The main appeal of one-step methods is that they are fully online and incremental, yet avoid the complexities of eligibility traces.\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} & \\doteq \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(G_{t: t+1}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)} \\\\ &=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)} \\\\ &=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha \\delta_{t} \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)} \\end{aligned}\n\nThe natural state-value-function learning method to pair with this is semi-gradient TD(0). The pseudocode is shown below.\n\nThe generalizations to the forward view of n-step methods and then to a \\lambda-return algorithm are straightforward.\n\n5.5. Policy Gradient for Continuing Problems\nAs discussed previously, for continuing problems without episode boundaries we need to define performance in terms of the average rate of reward per time step:\n\n\\begin{aligned} J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\doteq r(\\pi) & \\doteq \\lim _{h \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{t=1}^{h} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t} | S_{0}, A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right] \\\\ &=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t} | S_{0}, A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right] \\\\ &=\\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right) r \\end{aligned}\n\nwhere \\mu is the steady-state distribution under \\pi, \\mu(s) \\doteq \\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left\\{S_{t}=s \\; | \\; A_{0: t} \\sim \\pi\\right\\} which is assumed to exist and to be independent of S_{0} (an ergodicity assumption).\n\n\\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) p\\left(s^{\\prime} | s, a\\right)=\\mu\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right),$ for all $s^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}\n\nNaturally, in the continuing case, we define values, v_{\\pi}(s) \\doteq \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t} | S_{t}=s\\right] and q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\doteq \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t} | S_{t}=s, A_{t}=a\\right], with respect to the differential return:\n\nG_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}-r(\\pi)+R_{t+2}-r(\\pi)+R_{t+3}-r(\\pi)+\\cdots\n\nWith these alternate definitions, the policy gradient theorem as given for the episodic case remains true for the continuing case.\n\n"},"notes/TRPO.html":{"url":"notes/TRPO.html","title":"Trust Region Policy Optimization","keywords":"","body":" Trust Region Policy Optimization1.

Summary\n\nTwo features of cryptocurrency mining that are key:\nIt is easy for profit-driven miners to participate in multiple mining pools\nthe dynamic adjustment of mining difficulty required for ensuring a stable block production rate leads to an arms race, creating a negative externality in which each individual’s acquisition of hash rates directly hurts others’ payoffs\n\n\nThe certainty equivalent of joining a mining pool more than doubles that of solo mining\nThe total revenue in crypto-mining stays the same whether two miners join force or not\nWithout friction (without passive hash rate), every active miner owns an equal share of each mining pool, irrelevant to the exact pool size. Pool managers charge zero fees due to Bertrand competition, otherwise one pool manager can cut her fee to steal the entire market.\nAs a result, the folk wisdom in the blockchain community that pools become concentrated for better risk sharing is misguided, as long as miners can freely allocate their hash rates.\n\n\nWith friction, a larger incumbent pool optimally charges a higher fee, which slows its percentage growth relative to smaller pools. Therefore, pool sizes mean-revert endogenously.\nA larger pool has a larger impact on global hash rates and consequently charges a higher fee and accommodates proportionally less active hash rates, reminiscent of traditional oligopolistic models where larger producers charge higher prices and produce less. Consequently, in the long run we expect a relatively decentralized market structure in the global mining industry may sustain and no single pool would grow too dominant.\n\n\nThe global hash rates is much higher for multiple mining pools, compared to solo mining mode. As expected, the homogeneous two-pool equilibrium generates lower global hash rates compared to the full risk-sharing equilibrium. Intuitively, pool managers with some market power take into account the arms race effect and hence discourage active miners’ hash rate acquisition by raising their fees. Even when we give the best chance of this market-power force to produce a countervailing effect by considering the lowest possible of number of pools (here, M = 2), quantitatively there is no big difference from the full risk-sharing case. The takeaway is that no matter whether we consider the friction of passive mining, the emergence of mining pools as a form of financial innovation escalates the mining arms race and contributes to its explosive growth in energy consumption in recent years.\n\n1.1. Model\nTechnology rules that for all practical purposes the probability of finding a solution is not affected by the number of trials attempted. This well-known memoryless property implies that the event of finding a solution is captured by a Poisson process with the arrival rate proportional to a miner’s share of hash rates globally. Given a unit hash cost $c$ and a dollar award R for each block, the payoff to a miner who has a hash rate of \\lambda_A operating over a period T is\n\nX_{solo} - c \\lambda_A T, \\text{ where } X_{solo} = B_{solo} R, \\; \\; B_{solo} \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson} \\left(\\frac{1}{D} \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\Lambda} T\\right).\n\nHere, B_{solo} is the number of blocks the miner finds within T—a Poisson distributed random variable capturing the risk that a miner faces in this mining game; \\Lambda denotes global hash rate (i.e., the sum of hash rates employed by all miners, whether individual or pool); D = 60×10 is a constant so that on average one block is created every 10 minutes.\nThe payoff to a participating miner with hash rate \\lambda_A who joins a pool with existing hash rate \\Lambda_B is\n\nX_{pool} - c \\lambda_A T, \\text{ where } X_{pool} = \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\lambda_A + \\Lambda_B} B_{pool} R, \\; \\; B_{pool} \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson} \\left(\\frac{1}{D} \\frac{\\lambda_A + \\Lambda_B}{\\Lambda} T\\right).\n\nX_{pool} second-order stochastically dominates X_{solo}, so any risk-averse miner strictly prefers X_{pool} over X_{solo}.\nThroughout the paper we use preference with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), i.e., exponential utility with risk-aversion parameter \\rho:\n\nu(x) := \\frac{1}{\\rho} (1 - e^{-\\rho x}).\n\n"},"notes/ES_2014_majority.html":{"url":"notes/ES_2014_majority.html","title":"Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable","keywords":"","body":" Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable1.

The honest nodes continue to mine on the public chain, while the pool mines on its own private branch. If the pool discovers more blocks, it develops a longer lead on the public chain, and continues to keep these new blocks private. When the public branch approaches the pool’s private branch in length, the selfish miners reveal blocks from their private chain to the public.\nThis strategy leads honest miners that follow the Bitcoin protocol to waste resources on mining cryptopuzzles that end up serving no purpose. While both honest and selfish parties waste some resources, the honest miners waste proportionally more, and the selfish pool’s rewards exceed its share of the network’s mining power, conferring it a competitive advantage and incentivizing rational miners to join the selfish mining pool.\nAbove a certain threshold size, the revenue of a selfish pool rises superlinearly with pool size above its revenue with the honest strategy.\nThis strategy shows that Bitcoin’s mining algorithm is not incentive compatible.\n\n\n"},"notes/lazy-prices.html":{"url":"notes/lazy-prices.html","title":"Lazy Prices","keywords":"","body":" Lazy Prices1.

Summary\nFor adaptively collected data in a potential outcome model, naive average results in a biased estimation, and the inverse-probability weighting estimator results in a non-normal asymptotic distribution. This paper propose a test statistic that is asymptotically unbiased and normal.\n2. Details\nDenote our data as (W_t, Y_t), The random variables W_{t} \\in \\mathcal{W} are called the arms, treatments or interventions. Arms are categorical. The reward or outcome Y_{t} represents the individual's response to the treatment. The treatment assignment probabilities e_{t}(w):=\\mathbb{P}\\left[W_{t}=w \\mid H^{t-1}\\right], also called propensity scores, are time-varying and decided via some known algorithm. Given this setup, we are concerned with the problem of estimating and testing pre-specified hypotheses about the value of an arm, denoted by Q(w):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{t}(w)\\right], as well as differences between two such values, denoted by \\Delta\\left(w, w^{\\prime}\\right):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{t}(w)\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{t}\\left(w^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]. \nIPW estimator is defined as\n\n\\widehat{Q}_{T}^{I P W}(w):=\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{I P W}(w), \\quad \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{I P W}(w):=\\frac{\\mathbb{I}\\left\\{W_{t}=w\\right\\}}{e_{t}(w)} Y_{t},\n\nand the augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimator is defined as\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\widehat{Q}_{T}^{A I P W}(w):=\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{A I P W}(w) \\\\\n&\\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{A I P W}(w):=\\frac{\\mathbb{I}\\left\\{W_{t}=w\\right\\}}{e_{t}(w)} Y_{t}+\\left(1-\\frac{\\mathbb{I}\\left\\{W_{t}=w\\right\\}}{e_{t}(w)}\\right) \\hat{m}_{t}(w).\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe symbol \\hat{m}_{t}(w) denotes an estimator of the conditional mean function m(w)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{t}(w)\\right] based on the history H^{t-1}, but it need not be a good one: it could be biased or even inconsistent (doubly robust estimator). The second term of \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{A I P W}(w) acts as a control variate: adding it preserves unbiasedness but can reduce variance, as it has mean zero conditional on H^{t-1} and, if \\hat{m}_{t}(w) is a reasonable estimator of m(w), is negatively correlated with the first term.\nInverse-probability weighting fixes the bias problem but results in a non-normal asymptotic distribution. In fact, when the probability of assignment to the arm of interest tends to zero, the inverse probability weights increase, which in turn causes the tails of the distribution to become heavier.\nThis paper considers the adaptively-weighted AIPW estimator:\n\n\\widehat{Q}_{T}^{h}(w)=\\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} h_{t}(w) \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{A I P W}(w)}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} h_{t}(w)},\n\nwith a sequence of evaluation weights h_t(w).

Summary\nThis paper consider the problem of M-estimators for contextual bandit under the adaptive collected data scheme. Using particular adaptive weights, the M-estimators can be used to construct asymptotically valid confidence regions for a variety of inferential targets.\n2. Settings\nWe assume that the data we have after running a contextual bandit algorithm is comprised of contexts \\left\\{X_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}, actions \\left\\{A_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}, and primary outcomes \\left\\{Y_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T} . T is deterministic and known. We use potential outcome notation and let \\left\\{Y_{t}(a): a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\right\\} denote the potential outcomes of the primary outcome and let Y_{t}:=Y_{t}\\left(A_{t}\\right) be the observed outcome. We assume a stochastic contextual bandit environment in which \\left\\{X_{t}, Y_{t}(a): a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\right\\} \\stackrel{i . i . d}{\\sim} \\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathbf{P} for t \\in[1: T]. We define the history \\mathcal{H}_{t}:=\\left\\{X_{t^{\\prime}}, A_{t^{\\prime}}, Y_{t^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{t^{\\prime}=1}^{t} for t \\geq 1 and \\mathcal{H}_{0}:=\\emptyset. Actions A_{t} \\in \\mathcal{A} are selected according to policies \\pi:=\\left\\{\\pi_{t}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}, which define action selection probabilities \\pi_{t}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}, \\mathcal{H}_{t-1}\\right):=\\mathbb{P}\\left(A_{t} \\mid \\mathcal{H}_{t-1}, X_{t}\\right).\nWe assume that \\theta^*(\\mathcal{P}) is a conditionally maximizing value of criterion m_{\\theta}, i.e., for all \\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathbf{P},\n\n\\theta^{*}(\\mathcal{P}) \\in \\underset{\\theta \\in \\Theta}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{P}}\\left[m_{\\theta}\\left(Y_{t}, X_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\mid X_{t}, A_{t}\\right].\n\nThe M-estimator is defined as\n\n\\hat{\\theta}_{T}:=\\underset{\\theta \\in \\Theta}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} m_{\\theta}\\left(Y_{t}, X_{t}, A_{t}\\right).\n\n3. Adaptively Weighted M-Estimators\nOur proposed estimator for \\theta^*(\\mathcal{P}), \\hat{\\theta}_{T}, is the maximizer of a weighted version of the M-estimation criterion,\n\n\\hat{\\theta}_{T}:=\\underset{\\theta \\in \\Theta}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} W_{t} m_{\\theta}\\left(Y_{t}, X_{t}, A_{t}\\right)=: \\underset{\\theta \\in \\Theta}{\\operatorname{argmax}} M_{T}(\\theta),\n\nwhere \n\nW_{t}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_{t}^{\\text {sta }}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}\\right)}{\\pi_{t}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}, \\mathcal{H}_{t-1}\\right)}}.\n\nHere \\left\\{\\pi_{t}^{\\mathrm{sta}}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1} are pre-specified stabilizing policies that do not depend on data \\left\\{Y_{t}, X_{t}, A_{t}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}. A default choice for the stabilizing policy when the action space is of size |\\mathcal{A}| is just \\pi_{t}^{\\mathrm{sta}}(\\bar{a}, x)=1 /|\\mathcal{A}| for all x, a, t. \nThis weight is very similar to the result in Hadid et al. (2021), where \\pi_{t}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}, \\mathcal{H}_{t-1}\\right) serves as the propensity score and \\pi_{t}^{\\mathrm{sta}}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}\\right) is basically a constant.\nTo construct uniformly valid confidence regions for \\theta^{*}(\\mathcal{P}) we prove that \\hat{\\theta}_{T} is uniformly asymptotically normal in the following sense:\n\n\\Sigma_{T}(\\mathcal{P})^{-1 / 2} \\ddot{M}_{T}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{T}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{T}-\\theta^{*}(\\mathcal{P})\\right) \\stackrel{D}{\\rightarrow} \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, I_{d}\\right) \\text { uniformly over } \\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathbf{P},\n\nwhere \\ddot{M}_{T}(\\theta):=\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial^{2} \\theta} M_{T}(\\theta) and \\Sigma_{T}(\\mathcal{P}):=\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{P}, \\pi_{t}^{s t a}}\\left[\\dot{m}_{\\theta^{*}(\\mathcal{P})}\\left(Y_{t}, X_{t}, A_{t}\\right)^{\\otimes 2}\\right]. We define \\dot{m}_{\\theta}:=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} m_{\\theta}. Similarly we define respectively \\ddot{m}_{\\theta} and \\dddot{m}_{\\theta} as the second and third partial derivatives of m_{\\theta} with respect to \\theta. For any vector z we define z^{\\otimes 2}:=z z^{\\top}. \nNotice that the basic conditions and intuitions behind these can be traced back to the classical asymptotic results for M-estimator (Van der Vaart.

Summary\n\nNothing-at-stake is one of the downsides of Proof-of-Stake. The problem is that the lack of an explicit cost (compared to Proof-of-Work in Bitcoin) coupled with the explicit benefit of the block reward implies that a validator will always update the ledger whenever given the opportunity even if the update necessarily perpetuates disagreement.\n\nThis paper examines the nothing-at-stake problem using a formal economic analysis. The key results can be summarized as follows:\n\nAdding a block to the shorter branch on the blockchain has two effects for the player appending the block. \n\nThe first effect is that the player receives a block reward in terms of coins on that branch; this first effect creates an incentive for the player to append the block. \nThe second effect is that the value of all coins falls; this second effect competes with the first effect and discourages the player from adding a block to the shorter branch. \n\n\nA myopic player with no coins always appends to the blockchain when given the option if the block reward takes a strictly positive value. Alternatively, a player with a large stake opts not to append to the blockchain when doing so defers consensus due to the prohibitive cost incurred via her stake being devalued. An equilibrium in which all players follow the Longest Chain Rule exists if each player holds a sufficient stake. In this case, the long chain rule strategy also constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium. (second effect dominates)\n\nIf there is no block rewards, then there exists an equilibrium in which each player follows the longest chain rule. In other words, a Proof-of-Stake blockchain obtains consensus without further conditions if the blockchain possesses no block reward. (first effect is eliminated)\nThe Proof-of-Stake does not lead to wealth concentration. In expectation, one's wealth share remains the same.\n\n\n\n"},"notes/green_2019_jfe.html":{"url":"notes/green_2019_jfe.html","title":"Crowdsourced employer reviews and stock returns","keywords":"","body":" Crowdsourced employer reviews and stock returns1.

Summary\n【028】乌合之众 or 群众的智慧：员工评价与股票收益\n\n作者找到了一个很棒的数据集—— Glassdoor 提供的员工评价数据——并以此为基础进行了研究。Glassdoor 提供了员工对公司的综合评价和 5 个子项（职业机会，薪酬福利，工作/生活平衡度，高层管理，企业文化与价值）的标准化评价，所有评价皆为 1 至 5 星。此外，员工还可以输入任意文字说明自己眼中公司的优点和不足。最后，自 2012 年起，Glassdoor 还额外提供关于公司未来前景的调查数据。该数据集包含 2008 至 2016 年间，共 1238 家公司 16602 个公司-季度样本。\n由于评价数据总量较少，因此，作者采用了季度换仓，而非常见的月度换仓。特别地，为了保证评价可靠，他们要求公司在最近两个季度至少各有 15 条评价记录。在此基础上，作者依据员工评价变化将股票分为 5 组。理论上，员工评价变高，意味着经济环境及公司前景很可能在变好，在其他条件相同的情况下，公司应有更好的表现。\n结果显示，最近一个季度员工评价上升的公司，确实有着更好的表现，无论是等权还是市值加权组合，价差组合都有着显著的超额收益和Fama–French–Carhart 四因子 alpha 。(此处使用Newey–West t-statistic 进行检验)\n此外，高低评价变化组合的主要公司特征（beta、规模和 BM）基本一致，动量也非常接近，而员工评价变化平均相差超过 1 星。这显示组合表现的差异，很可能不能由其他因素所解释。\nFama-MacBeth 回归分析进一步支持了这一点。无论是单变量回归，还是控制了不同的公司特征后，员工评价变化都有显著的风险溢价。\n另外，员工评价变化的影响主要是短期效应，因其对 2/3/4 个月后的当月收益没有显著影响。\n\n\n\n"},"notes/SoK.html":{"url":"notes/SoK.html","title":"A Survey of Attacks on Ethereum Smart Contracts","keywords":"","body":" A Survey of Attacks on Ethereum Smart Contracts1.

Summary\nSome of the primitives used in Solidity to invoke func- tions and to transfer ether may have the side effect of invoking the fallback function of the callee/recipient. We illustrate them below.\n\ncall invokes a function (of another contract, or of itself), and transfers ether to the callee. E.g., one can invoke the function ping of contract  c as follows:\nc.call.value(amount)(bytes4(sha3(\"ping(uint256)\")),n);\n\nwhere the called function is identified by the first 4 bytes of its hashed signature, amount determines how many wei have to be transferred to c, and n is the actual parameter of ping. Remarkably, if a function with the given signature does not exist at address c, then the fallback function of c is executed, instead.\n\nsend is used to transfer ether from the running contract to some recipient r, as in r.send(amount). After the ether has been transferred, send executes the recipient’s fallback.\n\ndelegatecall is quite similar to call, with the difference that the invocation of the called function is run in the caller environment. For instance, executing \nc.delegatecall(bytes4(sha3(\"ping(uint256)\")),n)\n\nif ping contains the variable this, it refers to the caller’s address and not to c, and in case of ether transfer to some recipient d — via d.send(amount) — the ether is taken from the caller balance.\n\nbesides the primitives above, one can also use a direct call as follows:\ncontract Alice { function ping(uint) returns (uint) }\ncontract Bob   { function pong(Alice c){ c.ping(42); } }\n\nThe first line declares the interface of Alice’s contract, and the last two lines contain Bob’s contract: therein, pong invokes Alice’s ping via a direct call. Now, if the programmer mistypes the interface of contract Alice (e.g., by declaring the type of the parameter as int, instead of uint), and Alice has no function with that signature, then the call to ping actually results in a call to Alice’s fallback function.\n\n\nHere is a list of vulnerabilities\n\nException disorder. In Solidity there are several situations where an excep- tion may be raised, e.g. if (i) the execution runs out of gas; (ii) the call stack reaches its limit; (iii) the command throw is executed. However, Solidity is not uniform in the way it handles exceptions: there are two different behaviours, which depend on how contracts call each others.\nif every element of the chain is a direct call, then the execution stops, and every side effect (including transfers of ether) is reverted. Further, all the gas allocated by the originating transaction is consumed;\nif at least one element of the chain is a call (the cases delegatecall and send are similar), then the exception is propagated along the chain, reverting all the side effects in the called contracts, until it reaches a call. From that point the execution is resumed, with the call returning false10. Further, all the gas allocated by the call is call.\n\n\nGasless send. When using the function send to transfer ether to a contract, it is possible to incur in an out-of-gas exception. This may be quite unex- pected by programmers, because transferring ether is not generally associated to executing code.\nType casts. The Solidity compiler can detects some type errors.\nReentrancy. The fallback mechanism may allow an attacker to re-enter the caller function. This may result in unexpected behaviours, and possibly also in loops of invoca- tions which eventually consume all the gas.\nKeeping secrets. Declaring a field as private does not guarantee its secrecy. This is because, to set the value of a field, users must send a suitable transaction to miners, who will then publish it on the blockchain. Since the blockchain is public, everyone can inspect the contents of the transaction, and infer the new value of the field.\nImmutable bugs. Once a contract is published on the blockchain, it can no longer be altered. \nStack size limit. Each time a contract invokes another contract (or even itself via `this.f()) the call stack associated with the transaction grows by one frame. The call stack is bounded to 1024 frames: when this limit is reached, a further invocation throws an exception.\n\n"},"notes/Lee_2019_jfe.html":{"url":"notes/Lee_2019_jfe.html","title":"Technological Links and Predictable Returns","keywords":"","body":" Technological Links and Predictable Returns1.

Summary\nThis paper studies the crowdsourced stock ranking data from Forcerank. It shows that investors extrapolate from stocks’ recent past returns, with more weight on more recent returns, es- pecially when recent returns are negative, salient, or from a dispersed cross-section. Such extrapolative beliefs are stronger among nonprofessionals and large stocks.\n\nRegression using consensus Forcerank score as the dependent variable and past stock returns as the explanatory variables. \n\nThe coefficients on the past 12 weekly returns are all positive and mostly significant. More important, the coefficients on recent past returns are in general higher than those on distant past returns.\nThey further decompose past weekly returns into their systematic and idiosyncratic components using the CAPM. The results show that investors extrapolate only from past idiosyncratic returns.\n\n\nWe have observed a clear and robust decay pattern in the relation between investors’ current return expec- tation and recent past returns. To capture this pattern parsimoniously, we now estimate a parametric regression model that assumes an exponential decay of weights on past returns:\n\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  &\\text { Forcerank }_{i, t}=\\lambda_{0}+\\lambda_{1} \\cdot \\sum_{s=0}^{n} w_{s} R_{i, t-s}+\\varepsilon_{i, t} \\\\\n  &\\text { where } w_{s}=\\frac{\\lambda_{2}^{s}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\lambda_{2}^{j}}.\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \n\n\n\nThe first parameter, \\lambda_1—a scaling factor that multiplies all past returns of stock i—captures a “level” effect (i.e., the overall extent to which investor expectations respond to these past returns). The second parameter, \\lambda_2— which governs how past returns are relatively weighted in forming expectations—captures a “slope” effect: a \\lambda_2 closer to zero means that investors put much higher weight on recent past returns as opposed to distant past returns. \n\nThe parametric regression reports an estimate of 34.12 for \\lambda_{1} and an estimate of 0.55 for \\lambda_{2}. These joint estimates suggest that Forcerank participants exhibit a strong degree of extrapolation. \n\nInterestingly, between professional and nonprofessional users, the extrapolation parameters are quite different. We find that financial professionals have a \\lambda_{1} of 26.35, which is lower than that of the nonprofessionals (33.77), suggesting that professionals rely less on past stock returns when forming expectations about stock returns over the next week. Moreover, professionals have a \\lambda_{2} of 0.773, which is higher than that of the nonprofessionals (0.552).\n\n\nTo develop a deeper understanding of expectation formation, we generalize the parametric regression by separately estimating \\lambda_{1} and \\lambda_{2} for past returns of different characteristics. \n\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\text { Forcerank }_{i, t}=& \\lambda_{0}+\\lambda_{1, p} \\cdot \\sum_{s=0}^{n} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{R_{i, t-s} \\geq 0\\right\\}} \\cdot w_{s, p} R_{i, t-s} +\\lambda_{1, n} \\cdot \\sum_{s=0}^{n} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{R_{i, t-s}\nwhere w_{s, p}=\\frac{\\lambda_{2, p}^{s}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\lambda_{2, p}^{j}} and w_{s, n}=\\frac{\\lambda_{2, n}^{s}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\lambda_{2, n}^{j}}.\n\nThe results show that return extrapolation is asymmetric. In particular, individuals seem to put more weight on negative past returns -\\lambda_{1, n} is much larger than \\lambda_{1, p}-and this weight decays more slowly into the past for negative past returns - \\lambda_{2, n} is much higher than \\lambda_{2, p} and is therefore much closer to one. \n\n\nTo understand the source of the return predictability, we further decompose the Forcerank score into two components: a predicted score and the residual. The predicted score is computed as the fitted value from the nonlinear regression. Then we run regressions where future returns is Y and these scores are the explanatory variables.\n\nForcerank score and the predicted score both drive out past-return measures when they are included in the same regression.\nBy construction, the residual score is orthogonal to past returns. Interestingly, regressions show that the residual score also negatively predicts the next week’s return, with or without controlling for past returns. This finding suggests that the predictive power of the Forcerank score is not completely driven by its association with past returns. \nA large literature on the short-term return reversal has already shown that the past return of a stock negatively predicts its future return and this reversal can be driven by liquidity shocks unrelated to return extrapolation (see Jegadeesh and Titman, 1995 and Campbell et al., 1993, among others). A priori, we do not expect liquidity shocks to be the main explanation for return predictability because stocks in our sample tend to be very large stocks.\nTo evaluate the economic significance of our return predictability results, we form trading strategies. At the beginning of each week, we sort the stocks into five quintiles based on different variables. The portfolio is rebalanced every week. Stocks with prices below $5 at the beginning of the week are removed to reduce the impact of illiquidity.\nThe low-score-minus-high-score re- turn spread is 8.11 bps per day (t-value of 2.33). The return spread remains significant after risk adjustments using the CAPM, the Fama-French five-factor model, or the five-factor model augmented with the momentum factor and the short-term reversal factor.\n\n\n\n​        \n"},"notes/Parsons_2020_rfs.html":{"url":"notes/Parsons_2020_rfs.html","title":"Geographic Lead-Lag Effects","keywords":"","body":" Geographic Lead-Lag Effects1.

As a consequence, stock prices underreact to earnings surprises, resulting in predictable future abnormal returns. Such misperceptions about the subsequent earnings should be corrected at reasonably short time horizons when new earnings are reported. Consistent with this hypothesis, evidence in the literature suggesting that the resulting mispricing is corrected over the next few quarterly earnings announcements.\nAn under-extrapolative belief regime (their \"mean-reverting\" regime) leads to post-earnings announcement drift and momentum. In this regime the positive returns that follow a positive earnings surprise dissipate rapidly when the next few earnings surprises prove earnings to be higher than expected.\n\n\nLong term: investors who are overconfident about their private information signals will overreact to these signals, leading to a value effect wherein firms with high stock valuations relative to fundamental measures subsequently experience low returns. \nOwing to overconfidence in their private signals, investors are relatively unwilling to correct their perceptions as further (public) earnings news arrives. The correction of overconfidence-driven mispricing will take place over a much longer time horizon than mispricing that derives solely from limited attention.\nThe over-extrapolative (\"trending\") regime is more persistent, because a brief trend-opposing sequence of earnings surprises does not provide sufficient evidence to overcome the extrapolative expectations investors have formed about more distant earnings.\nWhen a firm becomes over- or underpriced, the optimal response for the firm is to issue or repurchase its own stock, while not necessarily changing its level of investment. Since managers have superior information about the intrinsic value of their firms, they are well-positioned to lead their firms to act as arbitrageurs of their own stock. If investors were fully rational, they would fully impound the information contained in a firm’s decision to issue or repurchase equity, so that the financing decision would not predict future returns. However, in models of investor overconfidence, the market does not fully impound this information, so market timing leads to return predictability.\nFor several reasons, it is much less likely to capture shorter-horizon mispricing. Equity issuance and repurchase have disclosure, legal, underwriting, and other costs that likely constrain firms from issuing to exploit very short-horizon mispricing. There are also informational barriers to high-frequency issuance/repurchase strategies. Owing to these frictions, such corporate events tend to occur only occasionally, rather than as continuously updated responses to even transient changes in market conditions.\n\n\n\n\nThe long horizon factor FIN is a composite (average) of the 1-year net-share-issuance (NSI) and 5-year composite-share-issuance (CSI) measures of Pontiff and Woodgate (2008) and Daniel and Titman (2006), respectively. \n\n  \\text { Composite Share Issuance } \\iota(t-\\tau, t)=\\log \\left(\\frac{M E_{t}}{M E_{t-\\tau}}\\right)-r(t-\\tau, t),\n  \nwhere \\iota is the expression for CSI, \\tau is the period of time ago, t is the specified time with ME defined as the total Market Equity and r(t-\\tau, t) is the stock return between -\\tau and t. ME_t can also be calculated as N_t \\times P_t where N_t is the total number of shares outstanding at time t and P_t is the price of shares at time t.\nThe above equation can be difficult to relate to any stock characteristics or accounting fundamental data. However, with a simple transformation, we decompose the above equation as follows,\n\n  \\iota(t-\\tau, t) = \\log \\left(\\frac{M E_{t}}{M E_{t-\\tau}}\\right)-r(t-\\tau, t) = \\log \\left(\\frac{N_{t}}{N_{t-\\tau}}\\right)+\\log \\left(\\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-\\tau}}\\right)-r(t-\\tau, t).\n  \nTherefore, conceptualising the math functions into words, we have\n\n  \\iota(t-\\tau, t) =\\text { Change of Total Market Shares }+\\text { Price Return }-\\text { Total Return }.\n  \nRe-organising the results of above into two key elements: change of total market shares (includes buybacks and issuances) and trailing dividend yield,\n\n  \\iota(t-\\tau, t) =\\text { Change of Total Market Shares } -\\text {Trailing Dividend Yield}.\n  \nFrom the above equation, it is obvious that composite-share-issuance is comprised of two basic factors,\n\nShare Changes (including issuances and buybacks)\nDividend yield\n\n\n\n"},"notes/Stambaugh-Yuan-2017.html":{"url":"notes/Stambaugh-Yuan-2017.html","title":"Mispricing Factors","keywords":"","body":" Mispricing Factors1.

With such asymmetry, the mispricing within the overpriced category is likely to be more severe than the mispricing within the underpriced category.\nMoreover, this asymmetry is likely to be greater for small stocks than for large ones, given that small stocks present potential arbitrageurs with greater risk (idiosyncratic volatility). \nThus, simply averaging across mispricing categories would not neutralize the effects of mispricing, and the resulting SMB would have an overpricing bias.\n\n"},"notes/TSM.html":{"url":"notes/TSM.html","title":"Time Series Momentum","keywords":"","body":" Time Series Momentum1. 时序动量2. 时序动量的问题3. 时序动量与截面动量 Time Series Momentum\n\n因子动物园 - 时序动量真的更好吗？\n刀疤连 - 和趋势做纯纯的朋友\n\n学术上在解释因子的收益来源时，往往从两个角度入手：risk-based 和 mispricing。前者是经典金融学的角度，认为一个异象如果能获得超额收益，肯定是承担了某种讨厌的风险，超额收益是这种风险的补偿；后者从行为金融学的角度，认为要么是某种限制阻碍了异象的消失，要么是投资者认知偏差导致的行为不理性。\n1. 时序动量\n\nMoskowitz, Tobias J., Yao Hua Ooi, and Lasse Heje Pedersen. \"Time series momentum.\" Journal of financial economics 104, no. 2 (2012): 228-250.\n\n时序动量与横截面动量的区别\n\nCross-sectional momentum literature focuses on the relative performance of securities in the cross-section, finding that securities that recently outperformed their peers over the past three to 12 months continue to outperform their peers on average over the next month.\nTime series momentum focuses purely on a security’s own past return.\n\n\nThis positive time series momentum that partially reverse over the long-term may be consistent with initial under-reaction and delayed over-reaction, which theories of sentiment suggest can produce these return patterns\n\n有效市场假说认为，当出现某个重要的新信息时，价格会立即得到反应，以匹配最新的内在价值。然而，行为金融的角度认为，由于投资者认知偏差的纯在，市场并不是完全有效，而是慢慢地吸收新信息的影响。\n初始阶段，由于锚点效应 ( Anchoring )、处置效应 ( The disposition effect) 和非盈利操作等，导致价格对信息反应不足。\n锚点效应。投资者往往会把自己的观点锚定在最近历史数据上，不愿意很快改变自己的想法，当新消息到来时反应很迟钝，造成价格反应缓慢；\n处置效应。投资者往往会过早低卖出盈利股票以兑现收益；相反，对那些亏损的股票迟迟不肯止损。这样的后果是，上涨不会一蹴而就，下跌不会一跌到底，造成价格慢慢的移动；\n非盈利操作。一些非盈利操作，也会减缓价格的反应速度，例如中央银行在外汇市场和固定收益市场进行斡旋，以减少汇率和利率的波动。\n\n\n一旦趋势起来，就进入了第二阶段：趋势持续甚至过度反应，这往往是由于羊群效应 ( Herding ) ，以及确认和代表偏差 ( Confirmation bias 和 representativene)等因素导致的。\n羊群效应。羊群效应也叫从众效应，当投资者观点和其他大多数投资者观点不一致时，容易怀疑和改变自己的观点，以使得和群体一致。在价格上涨或下跌开启后，投资会想羊群一样，加入到趋势行情中来；\n确认和代表性偏差。行情开启后，投资者会用最近的价格变动来推断未来，选择性地关注最近盈利的方向；不仅如此，一旦确认了自己的观点，便会找各种数据和信息支持自己的看法，这使得价格趋势得以延续。\n\n\n最后，趋势不会永不眠，价格不会一直朝一个方向走下去。在趋势的末端，价格可能已经过度反应导致严重偏离基本面，因此最终会出现反转趋势宣告结束。\n\n\nWe focus on the most liquid instruments to avoid returns being contaminated by illiquidity or stale price issues and to match more closely an implementable strategy at a significant trade size.\n\nThe ex ante annualized variance \n\nThe ex ante annualized variance \\sigma_{t}^{2} for each instrument is calculated as follows:\n\n   \\sigma_{t}^{2}=261 \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}(1-\\delta) \\delta^{i}\\left(r_{t-1-i}-\\bar{r}_{t}\\right)^{2}.\n   \nwhere the scalar 261 scales the variance to be annual, the weights (1-\\delta) \\delta^{i} add up to one, and \\bar{r}_{t} is the exponentially weighted average return computed similarly. The parameter \\delta is chosen so that the center of mass of the weights is \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}(1-\\delta) \\delta^{i} i=\\delta /(1-\\delta)=60 days.\n\nThe regression is given by\n\n   r_{t}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-1}^{s}=\\alpha+\\beta_{h} r_{t-h}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-h-1}^{s}+\\varepsilon_{t}^{s},\n   \nor\n\n   r_{t}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-1}^{s}=\\alpha+\\beta_{h} \\operatorname{sign}\\left(r_{t-h}^{s}\\right)+\\varepsilon_{t}^{s}.\n   \n\n交易策略：For each instrument s and month t, we consider whether the excess return over the past k months is positive or negative and go long the contract if positive and short if negative, holding the position for h months. We set the position size to be inversely proportional to the instrument's ex ante volatility, 1 / \\sigma_{t-1}^{s}, each month. \n\n如果只考虑用过去12个月收益为基准，hold未来一个月的交易策略, the TSMOM return for any instrument s and month t is therefore:\n\n   r_{t, t+1}^{T S M O M, s}=\\operatorname{sign}\\left(r_{t-12, t}^{s}\\right) \\frac{40 \\%}{\\sigma_{t}^{s}} r_{t, t+1}^{s}.\n   \n\nIf we regress the TSMOM strategy for each security on the strategy of always being long (i.e., replacing ‘‘sign’’ with a 1 in the above equation), then we get a positive alpha in 90% of the cases (of which 26% are statistically significant; none of the few negative ones are significant).\n\n\nThe link between time series momentum returns and the positions of speculators and hedgers indicates that speculators profit from time series momen- tum at the expense of hedgers. This evidence is consistent with speculators earning a premium via time series momentum for providing liquidity to hedgers.\n\n\n2. 时序动量的问题\n\nHuang, Dashan, Jiangyuan Li, Liyao Wang, and Guofu Zhou. \"Time series momentum: Is it there?.\" Journal of Financial Economics 135, no. 3 (2020): 774-794.\n\n不同资产未调整的收益对未来收益的预测能力，并发现只有 8（3）种资产在 10%（5%）的显著性水平下有显著的预测能力。样本外表现则更加糟糕，有 45 种资产的样本外 R 方是负的。\n\n考虑MOP(2012)的回归，\n\n\n\nr_{t}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-1}^{s}=\\alpha+\\beta_{h} r_{t-h}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-h-1}^{s}+\\varepsilon_{t}^{s},\n\nmake an implicit assumption that the mean returns of all assets are the same by imposing a common intercept. To highlight fixed effects, a possible specification is\n\nr_{t}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-1}^{s}=\\alpha+\\beta_{h} r_{t-h}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-h-1}^{s}+ \\mu_s / \\sigma_s +\\varepsilon_{t}^{s}\n\nwhere \\mu_s and \\sigma_s are the unconditional mean and volatility of asset s. Hence, the estimate of \\beta should be\n\n\\hat{\\beta}=\\beta+\\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}\\left(r_{t-h+1}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-h}^{s}, \\mu_{s} / \\sigma_{s}\\right)}{\\operatorname{Var}\\left(r_{t-h+1}^{s} / \\sigma_{t-h}^{s}\\right)}.\n\nIf all assets have the same Sharpe ratio (or mean, if volatilities are the same), the second term is zero (\\mu_{s} / \\sigma_{s} is fixed). Otherwise, it would be significantly positive when the number of assets is large, as the correlation between realized returns and their means is mechanically positive. As a result, the slope estimate of MOP(2012) regression is biased upward.\n\nTwo more reasons:\n\nBecause volatility varies dramatically across assets, volatility scaling in the pooled regression without controlling for fixed effects can further exacerbate the upward bias.\nAs a predictor, the past 12-month cumulative return is persistent and can generate substantial size distortions. (large sample result when sample size is non-asymptotic, slow non-asymptotic rate).\n\n\n构建了一个 TSH 策略，which does not require predictability：\n\n   r_{t+1}^{T S H, s}=\\operatorname{sign}\\left(r_t^{s}\\right) r_{t+1}^{s}.\n   \n\nfind that the TSM and TSH strategies perform virtually the same and their differences in average returns, as well as in risk-adjusted ones, are indifferent from zero. We find that the performances of the TSM and TSH strategies mainly stem from their long legs, and their short legs have insignificant average and risk-adjusted returns.\nExamine the overall predictability of TSM across assets. The slope measures how realized returns are explained by predicted returns. If the past 12-month return perfectly predicts the next one-month return, the slope should have a value of one. We find that for the TSM forecasts the slope has a value close to zero. When regressing the TSM forecasts on the TSH forecasts, the slope is very close to one. This result indicates little difference in predictability between the two forecasts, suggesting, again, no evidence of TSM across the assets.\n显然，TSH 的持仓会比较稳定，不太会频繁调仓。某种程度上，TSH 类似买入持有（buy-and-hold），当然，严格来讲，不仅仅是 buy-and-hold ，还有 sell-and-hold 。\n\n\n\n3. 时序动量与截面动量\n\nGoyal, Amit, and Narasimhan Jegadeesh. \"Cross-sectional and time-series tests of return predictability: What is the difference?.\" The Review of Financial Studies 31, no. 5 (2018): 1784-1824.\n\n考虑到资产总体上会更多上涨而非下跌，做多过去收益率大于 0 的资产而做空过去收益率小于 0 的资产的时序动量平均而言会有净多头寸。相比之下，截面动量是完全对冲的、资金中性多空组合。To make these strategies directly comparable, we add to the CS strategy a time-varying investment in the market (TVM) equal to the dollar value of the difference between the long and short sides of the TS strategy each month.\n\n作者们进一步将净头寸带来的收益拆分为（静态持仓获取的）风险溢价和择时收益：\n\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   R_{t}^{T V M}&=\\operatorname{NetLong}_{t} \\times \\bar{R}_{t}=\\sum_{i} w_{i t-1}^{T S} \\times \\bar{R}_{t}, \\\\\n   \\overline{R_{t}^{T V M}}&=\\underbrace{\\overline{\\text { NetLong }_{t}} \\times \\overline{\\bar{R}_{t}}}_{\\text {Risk Premium }}+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\operatorname{NetLong}_{t}, \\bar{R}_{t}\\right)}_{\\text {Market Timing }},\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \nwhere \\overline{\\mathrm{NetLong}_{t}} and \\overline{\\bar{R}}_{t} are the average net long position and the average equalweighted excess return, respectively, over the sample period.

(2017) 考虑了三种计算方法：\n\n     \\begin{aligned}\n     MVCE &= PE_{pre} \\times E+W \\\\\n     MVCE &= PE_{ind} \\times E+W \\\\\n     MVCE &= P_{Day1} \\times (S + \\Delta S)\n     \\end{aligned}\n     \n\n前两种方法中，E 是未上市公司的 earning forecast；W 是壳公司和未上市公司的净资产总和。这两种方法的区别在于市盈率 PE 的计算。在第一种方法中，PE_pre 代表了 peer-based PE ratio，它是壳公司自己根据同类公司的 PE 估计出来的市盈率；而在第二种方法中，PE_ind 代表了 industry-based PE ratio，它是壳公司所在行业的全部公司的平均市盈率。通常来说，PE_pre 大于 PE_ind。\n\n在一个完整的借壳上市过程中，壳公司首先会被停牌，随后会出现和它有关的资产重组的公告（不涉及任何细节）。在三到四个月后，壳公司会复牌，并伴随最初的 reverse merger 的提案。由于 reverse merger 对壳公司是极大的利好，复牌后它的股票通常会经历几个涨停，P_Day1 代表了复牌后第一个非涨停的交易日的收盘价，它表示着市场已经完全 priced in 这个潜在的 reverse merger。P_{Day1} \\times  (S + \\Delta S) 就是第三种 MVCE 的计算方法。\n\n相对前两种方法，第三种计算 MVCE 的方法最为保守。这是因为最初的提案需要经过股东和董事会的批准得到最终的提案，而最终的提案还要经过证监会的审批，这其中存在很高的失败风险。因此，P_Day1 反映出来的壳价值是存在折价的，这就是第三种方法相对保守的原因。\n\n\n\n\n\nLee et al. (2017) 提出了一个 Expected Shell Value to Market (ESVM) 指标作为壳价值因子。顾名思义，它是预期壳价值和市值之比。Expected Shell Value 是成为壳的概率与 Shell Value 的乘积，ESVM是ESV divided by each firm’s market equity。\n\n成为壳的概率是用 市值、利润率、退市风险(ST)、所有权集中度等几个指标做自变量，进行logistic regression拟合的模型进行预测得到的\n\nShell Value 是 average prevailing shell value\n\n在屈、沈 (2018) 中，成为壳的概率考虑了额外的ROA、主营业务收入增长率、宏观政策下IPO拒绝率以及过去12个月的超额收益率等变量进行logistic regression\n\n在屈、沈 (2018) 中，SV 是一个根据借壳上市交易数据构建的壳价值指数：\n\n     S V_{i t}=\\exp \\left(-4.421+3.118 \\times \\ln M V_{i t-1}-0.187 \\times\\left(\\ln M V_{i t-1}\\right)^{2}-0.592 \\times S O E_{i t-1}\\right),\n     \n其中 MV是市值，SOE是是否为国企的dummy，是为1。\n\n\n\n屈、沈 (2018) 探讨了壳溢价的来源：\n\n假设1：市场存在套利成本 (错误)\n参考 Campbell et al. (2008)、Wang and Yu (2013) 等文献的做法，选取机构投资者持股、分析师覆盖率、异质波动率以及非流动性 4 个指标衡量套利成本。\nInstitutional Holdings:机构投资者持股比例。D'Avolio(2002) 发现，机构投资者持股比例越低的股票，越难融到券，因此越难以卖空，套利成本越大。\nAnalyst Coverage: 分析师覆盖率。分析师覆盖率越低的股票，投资者关注度越低，越可能发生反应不足的现象(Hong and Stein, 1999)，套利成本越大。\nIVOL: 异质性风险。Shleifer and Vishny (1997)预测异质波动率会阻碍套利行为，Pontiff(2006) 的研究结果表明异质波动率是套利者面临的最大的套利成本。因此，IVOL 越大,套利成本越大。\nIlliquidity : 非流动性指标 ( Amihud, 2002)。Illiquidity 值越大，说明单位订单流的价格影响越大，套利者的套利成本越大。\n\n\n由于套利成本的度量指标与股票规模有很高的相关度，为了避免分组结果受规模效应的影响，屈、沈 (2018) 参照 Hong et al. (2000)、Campbell et al. (2008) 等文献的做法，取上述变量对股票相对规模回归的残差作为对应套利成本的代理变量。\n壳溢价在高套利成本和低套利成本的股票中都显著存在,说明错误定价对壳溢价的解释能力非常有限。\n\n\n假设2：市场存在投资者情绪 (错误)\nStambaugh et al. (2012)发现大多数异象在高投资情绪时期更为显著、溢价更大，并且异象对冲组合的收益主要来自于卖空组合的负收益。这是因为在高投资者情绪时期卖空变得更为困难，套利者难以通过卖空手段套利，导致卖空组合过高估值严重。\n与大多数异象的不同，壳溢价在低投资者情绪时期显著,而在高投资情绪时期不显著，并且低投资者情绪时期的壳溢价远远大于高投资者情绪时期的溢价。\n\n\n假设3：IPO管制与壳溢价 (正确)\n在现行的 IPO 审核制下,证监会主要通过控制 IPO 企业审批数量的方式控制 IPO 节奏，实现对资本市场的管制。证监会不定期召开发审委员会议,对上会的 IPO 申请进行审 核,并实时公布审核结果。我们在月度频率上汇总了当月上会的 IPO 申请审核结果,并计 算了发审委每月对 IPO 申请的拒绝率。\n当 IPO 暂停时,借壳成为企业上市的唯一途径，上市公司被借壳的概率大幅增加，期望壳价值上升，从而导致壳溢价的大幅升高。\n\n\n假设4：高管制风险\n根据理性资产定价模型，股票的超额回报率来自于系统性风险补偿。 如果壳溢价反映了管制风险,那么壳溢价应该是对投资者承受管制风险的补偿。具体来说，当面临管制政策风险(不确定性)时，风险厌恶者会倾向于出售手中的壳股票，壳股票的当期价格下跌，从而导致政策风险兑现后壳股票会有一部分超额收益,这部分超额收益 (壳溢价) 就是对承受政策风险的投资者的风险补偿。\n用 EPU 指数( Baker et al., 2016) 作为管制政策不确定性的代理变量。EPU 指数记录了每个月关于中国经济政策不确定性新闻的频率，这些新闻涵盖的主题包括货币、 财政、监管、改革、税收、贸易等等。 $E P U$ 的优势在于其反映的政策不确定性是外生的、实时的，因此,当期的 EPU 越高，代表当期的政策不确定性越高。\n当面临管制政策不确定性时,风险厌恶投资者会倾向于出售暴露于管制风险的壳股票，转向相对安全的非壳股票，进而导致当期壳股票价格下跌非壳股票价格上升，政策风险兑现后壳股票有正的超额回报，而非壳股票有负的超额回报。因此，壳溢价就是对承受政策风险的投资者的风险补偿。\n\n\n\n\n\n​    \n"},"notes/cn_ff3.html":{"url":"notes/cn_ff3.html","title":"Size and Value in China","keywords":"","body":" Size and Value in China Size and Value in China\n\nLiu, Jianan, Robert F.

Use this observation to identify marketable retail price-improved orders from the Trade and Quote (TAQ) data\n\nRetail orders are typically executed by wholesalers or via internalization, meaning that orders are filled from a broker’s own inventory\nWholesalers are willing to provide a small price improvement to induce the retail trader’s broker to route the order to the wholesaler. Due to Regulation 606T, Internalizers need to show that they execute their clients’ orders optimally and thus also have incentives to provide price improvement to their clients. This price improvement is typically only a small fraction of a cent. \nInstitutional orders are almost never internalized or sold to wholesalers. Instead, their orders are sent to exchanges and dark pools, and Reg NMS prohibits these orders from having subpenny limit prices. Thus, institutional transaction prices are usually in round pennies. The only exception applies to midpoint trades. Reg NMS has been interpreted to allow executions at the midpoint between the best bid and best offer, this means that many institutional transactions are also reported at a half-penny price.\nTransactions with a retail seller tend to be reported on a TRF at prices that are just above a round penny due to the small price improvement, while transactions with a retail buyer tend to be reported on a TRF at prices just below a round penny.\n\n\nMeasuring marketable retail investors order imbalance:\n\nmrbvol: the average daily buy volume from marketable retail orders \n\nmrsvol: the average daily sell volume from marketable retail orders\n\nmrbtrd: the average number of buy trades from marketable retail orders\n\nmrstrd: the average number of sell trades from marketable retail orders\n\noddmrbvol and oddmrsvol: the daily averages of odd lot marketable retail buy and sell volumes (odd lot trades are trades of fewer than 100 shares)\n\noddmrbtrd and oddmrstrd: the daily averages of odd lot marketable retail buy and sell trades\n\n     \\begin{aligned}\n     \\text { mroibvol }(i, t) &=\\frac{\\operatorname{mrbvol}(i, t)-\\operatorname{mrsvol}(i, t)}{\\operatorname{mrbvol}(i, t)+\\operatorname{mrsvol}(i, t)} \\\\\n     \\operatorname{mroibtrd}(i, t) &=\\frac{\\operatorname{mrbtrd}(i, t)-m r s t r d(i, t)}{\\operatorname{mrbtrd}(i, t)+\\operatorname{mrstrd}(i, t)} \\\\\n     \\text { oddmroibvol }(i, t) &=\\frac{\\text { oddmrbvol }(i, t)-\\text { oddmrsvol }(i, t)}{\\text { oddmrbvol }(i, t)+\\text { oddmrsvol }(i, t)} \\\\\n     \\text { oddmroibtrd }(i, t) &=\\frac{\\text { oddmrbtrd }(i, t)-\\text { oddmrstrd }(i, t)}{\\text { oddmrbtrd }(i, t)+\\text { oddmrstrd }(i, t)}\n     \\end{aligned}\n     \n\n\n\nPredictability: the authors find that retail investors are slightly contrarian at a weekly horizon, and that the cross-section of weekly marketable retail order imbalances predicts the cross-section of returns over the next several weeks.\n\nThe explanation of predictive power: \n\nHypothesis 1 (persistence in retail order flow): as in Chordia and Subrahmanyam (2004), order flows are persistent, and, since the retail buying/selling pressure is also persistent, this could lead directly to the predictability of future returns\nHypothesis 2 (liquidity provision): as in Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (2008), these retail traders are contrarian at weekly horizons, and since their contrarian trading provides liquidity to the market, their trades might positively predict future returns.\nHypothesis 3 (informed trading): as in Kelley and Tetlock (2013), retail investors, especially ag- gressive investors using market orders, may have valuable information about the firm, and thus, their trading could correctly predict the direction of future returns \nSee paper P2276 - 2277 for the two-stage decomposition.\nThe empirical findings show that persistence in order flow and order flow driven by return reversals (the proxy for liquidity provision) account for about half of the predictive power of the marketable retail order imbalance for future returns.

Laplacian Matrix on Graph\nThe Laplacian matrix of a n-vertex graph \\mathcal{G} is defined as\n\nL = D - W,\n\nwhere W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n} is the adjacent matrix with weights W_{ij} and D = \\mathrm{diag}(D_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}, D_i = \\sum_{j}W_{ij} is the degree matrix. The normalized Laplacian matrix is defined as\n\nL_{N}=D^{-1 / 2}(D-W) D^{-1 / 2} = I_n - D^{-1 / 2} W D^{-1 / 2}.\n\nThe Laplace operator is defined as\n\n\\Delta f=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{i}^{2}},\n\nIn 1-dimensional space, we have\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{i}^{2}} =f^{\\prime \\prime}(x) \n& \\approx f^{\\prime}(x)-f^{\\prime}(x-1) \\\\\n& \\approx f(x+1)-f(x)-(f(x)-f(x-1)) \\\\\n&=f(x+1)+f(x-1))-2 f(x).\n\\end{aligned}\n\nSimilarly, if we consider a n-vertex graph \\mathcal{G} and a function \\mathbf{f} on it,\n\n\\mathbf{f} = (f_1, \\ldots, f_n),\n\nwhere f_i is the function value of the i-th vertex in the graph. Then the Laplacian operation on this function \\mathbf{f} on graph \\mathcal{G} should be\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta f_{i} =\\sum_{j \\in N_{i}} \\frac{\\partial f_{i}}{\\partial j^{2}} & \\approx \\sum_{j} W_{i j}\\left(f_{i}-f_{j}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\sum_{j} W_{i j}\\left(f_{i}-f_{j}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\left(\\sum_{j} W_{i j}\\right) f_{i}-\\sum_{j} W_{i j} f_{j} \\\\\n&=D_{i} f_{i}-\\sum_{j} W_{i j} f_{j}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\nIn a vector form, we can recover the definition of Laplacian matrix on graph \\mathcal{G},\n\n\\Delta \\mathbf{f} = (D - W) \\mathbf{f} = L \\mathbf{f}.\n\nFor an undirected graph, the Laplacian matrix is a real symmetric matrix and therefore we have the spectral decomposition\n\nL = U \\Lambda U^\\top, \\;\\; \\Lambda = \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n).\n\nThere are also some properties for Laplacian matrix L, \n\nThere is at least one eigenvalue 0.\nAll the eigenvalues are non-negative. For normalized Laplacian matrix, all the eigenvalues are between 0 and 2, and the summation is n.\nIf there are k eigenvalues with value 0, then there are k mutually unconnected sub-graphs within the graph.\n\n2. Fourier Transformer\nRecall Fourier transformer of function f(\\cdot),\n\n\\mathcal{F}_{T}(\\omega)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(t) e^{-i \\omega t} d t,\n\nwhere \\{e^{-iwt}\\} is a set of orthogonal basis. We also have the inverse Fourier transformer,\n\nf(t)=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\mathcal{F}_{T}(\\omega) e^{i \\omega t} d \\omega.\n\nFor the basis function \\{e^{-iwt}\\}, notice that it is the eigenfunction for Laplacian operator \\Delta,\n\n\\Delta e^{-i \\omega t}=\\nabla^{2} e^{-i \\omega t}=\\frac{d e^{-i \\omega t}}{d t^{2}}=-\\omega^{2} e^{-i \\omega t}.\n\nSimilarly, the eigenvectors U = [\\mathbf{u}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{u}_n] of graph Laplacian matrix should also be the basis for the Fourier transformer on the graph \\mathcal{G}, i.e.,\n\n\\mathcal{F}_T\\left(\\lambda_{k}\\right) \\triangleq \\hat{f}_{k}= \\langle \\mathbf{f}, \\mathbf{u}_k \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i \\mathbf{u}_{k}(i).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\hat{\\mathbf{f}} = U^\\top \\mathbf{f}.\n\nSimilarly, we have the inverse Fourier transformer on graph \\mathcal{G},\n\n\\mathbf{f} = U \\hat{\\mathbf{f}} = U U^\\top \\mathbf{f}.\n\n3. Convolution on Graphs\nDenote the continuous convolution for two functions f, g,\n\n(f * g)(t) \\stackrel{\\text { def }}{=} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} f(\\tau) g(t-\\tau) d \\tau,\n\nas well as the discrete convolution,\n\n(f * g)(n)=\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(m) g(n-m)=\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(n-m) g(m).\n\nRecall the property for convolution and Fourier transformer,\n\n\\mathcal{F}\\{f * g\\}=\\mathcal{F}\\{f\\} \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{g\\}.\n\nTherefore,\n\nf * g=\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\left(\\mathcal{F}\\{f\\} \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{g\\} \\right).\n\nFor convolution operations on graph \\mathcal{G}, similarly, we have\n\n(\\mathbf{f} * \\mathbf{g})_{\\mathcal{G}} =\\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}\\{\\mathbf{f}\\} \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{\\mathbf{g}\\}] =\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left[U^{T} \\mathbf{f} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{g}}\\right] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left[\\mathrm{diag}(\\hat{g}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{g}_n) U^{T} \\mathbf{f} \\right].\n\nIf we parameterize \\hat{\\mathbf{g}} directly by trainable parameters \\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_n, \n\n(\\mathbf{f} * \\mathbf{g})_{\\mathcal{G}} = U \\mathrm{diag}(\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_n) U^{T} \\mathbf{f}.\n\nThis is the convolution filter on graphs.\n4. Fast Localized Spectral Filtering\n\nDefferrard, Michaël, Xavier Bresson, and Pierre Vandergheynst. \"Convolutional neural networks on graphs with fast localized spectral filtering.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 29 (2016).\n\nRecall that in the above graph convolution, \\hat{\\mathbf{g}} is a vector depending on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix L, we can rewrite it as\n\n\\hat{\\mathbf{g}} = g_\\theta(\\Lambda),\n\nand the graph convolution is then\n\n\\mathbf{y} = U g_\\theta(\\Lambda) U^{T} \\mathbf{x}.\n\nNotice that it can also be seen as a signal \\mathbf{x} filtered by g_\\theta as,\n\n\\mathbf{y} = g_\\theta(L) \\mathbf{x} = g_\\theta(U \\Lambda U^\\top) \\mathbf{x} = U g_\\theta(\\Lambda) U^{T} \\mathbf{x}.\n\nThe parameterization in the previous section can be seen as a non-parametric filter, i.e.,\n\ng_\\theta(\\Lambda) = \\mathrm{diag}(\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_n).\n\nThere are however two limitations with non-parametric filters: \n\nthey are not localized in space\ntheir learning complexity is in \\mathcal{O}(n), the dimensionality of the graph. \n\nThese issues can be overcome with the use of a polynomial filter,\n\ng_\\theta(\\Lambda) = \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\theta_{k} \\Lambda^{k}.\n\nUnder the polynomial filter, the convolution is given by \n\n\\mathbf{y} = U g_\\theta(\\Lambda) U^\\top \\mathbf{x} = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\theta_{k} L^{k}\\right) \\mathbf{x}.\n\nNotice that d_{\\mathcal{G}}(i, j)>K implies \\left(L^{K}\\right)_{i, j}=0, where d_{\\mathcal{G}} is the shortest path distance between i and j. Consequently, spectral filters represented by K^{\\text {th }} order polynomials of the Laplacian matrix are exactly K-localized. Besides, their learning complexity is \\mathcal{O}(K), the support size of the filter, and thus the same complexity as classical CNNs.\nHowever, the matrix computation of U matrix part still involves the \\mathcal{O}(n^2) computation complexity. Recall that the Chebyshev polynomial T_{k}(x) of order k may be computed by the stable recurrence relation \n\nT_{k}(x)=2 x T_{k-1}(x)-T_{k-2}(x),\n\nwith T_{0}=1 and T_{1}=x. These polynomials form an orthogonal basis for L^{2}\\left([-1,1], d y / \\sqrt{1-y^{2}}\\right), the Hilbert space of square integrable functions with respect to the measure d y / \\sqrt{1-y^{2}}. A filter can thus be parametrized as the truncated expansion,\n\ng_{\\theta}(\\Lambda)=\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\theta_{k} T_{k}(\\widetilde{\\Lambda}),\n\nwhere \n\n\\widetilde{\\Lambda}=2 \\Lambda / \\lambda_{\\max }-I_{n}\n\nis the normalized diagonal matrix with scaled eigenvalues that lie in [-1,1]. The convolution operation is therefore,\n\n\\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\theta_{k} T_{k}(\\widetilde{L}) \\mathbf{x}.\n\nHere \\widetilde{L}=2 L / \\lambda_{\\max }-I_{n}. Denoting \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_{k}=T_{k}(\\widetilde{L}) \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, we can use the recurrence relation to compute \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_{k}=2 \\widetilde{L} \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_{k-1}-\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_{k-2} with \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_{0}=\\mathbf{x} and \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_{1}=\\widetilde{L} \\mathbf{x}. The entire filtering operation then costs \\mathcal{O}(K|\\mathcal{E}|) operations, where |\\mathcal{E}| is the number of edges in the graph \\mathcal{G}.\n5. Fast Approximate Convolutions on Graphs\n\nKipf, Thomas N., and Max Welling. \"Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks.\" International Conference on Learning Representations (2017).\n\nRecall that in the previous section, we have the convolution operation on vector \\mathbf{x} of a graph \\mathcal{G} using Chebyshev polynomials,\n\n\\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\theta_{k} T_{k}(\\widetilde{L}) \\mathbf{x}.\n\nIf we consider the simple case of K=2 and consider the normalized Laplacian matrix L_N, and approximate \\lambda_{\\max}=2, which is the eigenvalue upper bound for L_N, we have\n\n\\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{k=0}^{1} \\theta_{k} T_{k}(\\widetilde{L}_N) \\mathbf{x} = \\theta_{0} \\mathbf{x}+\\theta_{1}\\left(L_N-I_{n}\\right) \\mathbf{x}=\\theta_{0} \\mathbf{x}-\\theta_{1} D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} W D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\mathbf{x}.\n\nIn practice, it can be beneficial to constrain the number of parameters further to address overfitting and to minimize the number of operations (such as matrix multiplications) per layer. This leaves us with the following expression using \\theta = \\theta_0 = - \\theta_1,\n\n\\mathbf{y} = \\theta \\mathbf{x} + \\theta D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} W D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\mathbf{x} = \\theta \\left(I_n + D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} W D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\right) \\mathbf{x}.\n\nNote that I_{n}+D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} W D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} now has eigenvalues in the range [0,2]. Repeated application of this operator can therefore lead to numerical instabilities and exploding/vanishing gradients when used in a deep neural network model. \nTo alleviate this problem, we introduce the following renormalization trick: \n\nI_{n}+D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} W D^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\rightarrow \\widetilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\widetilde{W} \\widetilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\n\nwith \\widetilde{W}=W+I_{N} and \\widetilde{D}_{i i}=\\sum_{j} \\widetilde{W}_{i j}.\nWe can generalize this definition to a signal X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times C} with C input channels (i.e. a C-dimensional feature vector for every node) and F filters or feature maps as follows,\n\nY=\\tilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\tilde{W} \\tilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} X \\Theta,\n\nwhere \\Theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times F} is now a matrix of filter parameters and Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F} is the convolved signal matrix. This filtering operation has complexity \\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{E}| F C), as \\tilde{W} X can be efficiently implemented as a product of a sparse matrix with a dense matrix.\n6. Simple GCN\n\nWu, Felix, Amauri Souza, Tianyi Zhang, Christopher Fifty, Tao Yu, and Kilian Weinberger. \"Simplifying graph convolutional networks.\" In International conference on machine learning, pp. 6861-6871. PMLR, 2019.\n\nFrom Kipf and Welling (2017) above, for a input X^{(t)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times C} with C input channels (i.e. a C-dimensional feature vector for every node) and F filters or feature maps as follows,\n\nX^{(t+1)}= \\sigma\\left(S X^{(t)} \\Theta \\right), \\; \\; S = \\tilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\tilde{W} \\tilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\nwhere \\Theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times F} is now a matrix of filter parameters, \\sigma is the non-liner activation function and X^{(t+1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F} is the convolved signal matrix. For a K-depth network, we will repeat the above procedure K times. \nThis paper hypothesizes that the nonlinearity between GCN layers is not critical - but that the majority of the benefit arises from the local averaging. The resulting model is linear, but still has the same increased “receptive field” of a K-layer GCN, i.e.,\n\nY =\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(S \\ldots S S X \\Theta^{(1)} \\Theta^{(2)} \\ldots \\Theta^{(K)}\\right) = \\operatorname{softmax} \\left(S^K X \\Theta\\right).\n\nUnder this network, the authors obtain a comparable experiment results with the previous structure, and the computation cost / the number of parameters is significantly reduced. Notice that S is a 2 |\\mathcal{E}|-sparse matrix, where |\\mathcal{E}| is the number of edges in the graph \\mathcal{G}, and the exponential computation for sparse matrix is quite fast.\n7. GraphSAGE\n\nHamilton, Will, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. \"Inductive representation learning on large graphs.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 30 (2017).\nGraphSAGE\n\nWe now consider the graph convolution from a different aspect. We mimic the logic of convolution on graph: for a 3x3 convolution layer, we conduct weighted average of the value of the 1-step neighbors of the center point. The next layer convolution operation increases the \"receptive field\" to the 2-step neighbors of the center point.\nThe algorithm is given below. For each step k=1, \\ldots, K, we first gather and aggregate all the hidden vecotr from previous step \\mathbf{h}_{u}^{k-1} in the neightbourhood of vertex v, i.e., u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v). Then in line 5, we combine the neighborhood information vector \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathcal{N}(v)}^k with \\mathbf{h}_{v}^{k-1} of v. \nThis process has been repeated K times and the information from all the K-step neighbor will be included.  Instead of training a distinct embedding vector for each node, this algorithm train a set of aggregator functions that learn to aggregate feature information from a node’s local neighborhood.\nThere are several choices of aggregator function:\n\nMean aggregator: which is the average of all the \\left\\{\\mathbf{h}_{u}^{k-1}, \\forall u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v)\\right\\}.\n\nPooling aggregator: each neighbor’s vector is independently fed through a fully-connected neural network; following this transformation, an elementwise max-pooling operation is applied to aggregate information across the neighbor set:\n\n  \\text { AGGREGATE }_{k}^{\\text {pool }}=\\max \\left(\\left\\{\\sigma\\left(W \\mathbf{h}_{u}^{k}+\\mathbf{b}\\right), \\forall u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v)\\right\\}\\right).\n  \n\n\n\n8.

Multiple Testing using Bootstrap\n\nHarvey, Campbell R., and Yan Liu. \"Lucky factors.\" Journal of Financial Economics 141, no. 2 (2021): 413-435.\n出色不如走运 II\n\n基本思路：通过正交化和 Bootstrap 得到了仅靠运气能够得到的显著性的经验分布，再用empirical statistics 来跟经验分布比较。\n2.1. Bootstrap on Panel Regression\nConsider a time series regression model,\n\nR_{i t}-R_{f t}=a_{i}+\\sum_{j=1}^{K} b_{i j} f_{j t}+\\epsilon_{i t}, i=1, \\ldots, N\n\nwhere N is the number of assets, and factor returns \\{f_{jt}\\} are long-short strategy returns corresponding to zero-cost investments.\n考虑我们现在已经有了K个factor如上式，增加一个新的factor f_{K+1 t} 进入模型我们可以得到，\n\nR_{i t}-R_{f t}=a_{i}^+ +\\sum_{j=1}^{K+1} b^*_{i j} f_{j t}+\\epsilon_{i t}, i=1, \\ldots, N\n\n在null hypothesis下，新的factor对于解释asset在cross-section上的return没有任何帮助，因此应该有 a_i = a^+_i. 我们考虑一个pseudo factor，f^\\prime_{K+1 t}, 为f_{K+1 t} 在前面f_{1t}, \\ldots, f_{Kt} 张成的空间上的投影，即\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{K+1t} &= \\delta_0 +\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\delta_{j} f_{j t}+\\epsilon_{t}, \\\\\nf^\\prime_{K+1t} &= f_{K+1t} - \\delta_0  = \\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\delta_{j} f_{j t}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\n在这种情况下，用原来的K个因子和这个pseudo因子对asset return 做回归，得到的结果只会rescale b_{ij}, 而不会改变a_i. \n\nThis adjustment makes economic sense. The adjusted factor, f^\\prime_{K+1 t}, is absorbed by the pre-selected factors \\{f_{j t}\\}_{j=1}^K in the sense that its premium is completely explained by its exposure to the pre-selected factors. When this happens, the adjusted factor has a zero incremental impact on the cross-section of expected returns. \nIn the meantime, it has perfect time series correlation with the original factor in sample and has the same time series correlation with the pre-selected variables as the original factor. Hence, the adjusted factor preserves the time series properties of the original factor aside from the mean.\n\n这种情况下，通过构造pseudo factor f^\\prime_{K+1 t}, 我们得到了与原有factor 保持时间序列上correlation性质，但同时在sample下满足null hypothesis (新的factor对于解释asset在cross-section上的return没有任何帮助) 的因子。\n我们通过在时间index上做bootstrap resample，并且重新做以下两个time series regression\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_{i t}-R_{f t}&=a_{i}(R) +\\sum_{j=1}^{K} b_{i j}(R) f_{j t}+\\epsilon_{i t}, i=1, \\ldots, N, \\\\\nR_{i t}-R_{f t}&=a_{i}^+(R) +\\sum_{j=1}^{K} b^*_{i j}(R) f_{j t}+ b^*_{i K+1}(R) f^\\prime_{K+1t} + \\epsilon_{i t}, i=1, \\ldots, N.\n\\end{aligned}\n\n并且通过\\{(a_i(R), a_i^+(R))\\} 计算test statistic，并给出在null hypothesis 下的test statistic 经验分布，来得出原本用(a_i, a_i^+) 计算的 test statistic 的p-value. \n几种test statistic的计算方法如下：\n\n最naive的\n\n\nS I_{e w}^{m} \\equiv \\frac{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(\\left|a_{i}^{+}\\right|-\\left|a_{i}\\right|\\right) / s_{i}}{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|a_{i}\\right| / s_{i}},\n\nwhere s_i is the standard deviation of a_i.\n\nA robust version that calculates the percentage difference in the scaled median absolute intercept\n\n\nS I_{e w}^{\\text {med }} \\equiv \\frac{\\operatorname{med}\\left(\\left\\{\\left|a_{i}^{+}\\right| / s_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}\\right)-\\operatorname{med}\\left(\\left\\{\\left|a_{i}\\right| / s_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}\\right)}{\\operatorname{med}\\left(\\left\\{\\left|a_{i}\\right| / s_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}\\right)}.\n\n\nValue-weighted statistic\n\n\nS I_{v w}^{m} \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{m e_{i, t}}{M E_{t}} \\times\\left(\\left|a_{i}^{+}\\right|-\\left|a_{i}\\right|\\right) / s_{i}}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{m e_{i, t}}{M E_{t}} \\times\\left|a_{i}\\right| / s_{i}},\n\nwhere \\left\\{m e_{i, t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T} is the time series of market equity for stock i, and M E_{t}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} m e_{i, t} is the aggregate market equity at time t.\nWe have several comments on the test statistics above:\n\nThe use of the scaled intercept takes the heterogeneity in return volatilities into account.\nWe scale the intercepts of the baseline model and the augmented model by the same standard error, that is, the standard error of the estimate of the intercept under the baseline model. This ensures that our test statistics are exactly zero when the null hypothesis, i.e., the candidate factor has zero incremental contribution to explain the cross-section of expected returns, is forced to exactly hold in sample for our procedure. This might not hold under alternative scaling schemes.\nFor the first factor f_{1t}, we can subtract the in-sample mean of f_{1t} from its time series. In this way, we are projecting f_{1t} onto a vector of all ones.\n\n2.2. Bootstrap for predictive regression\n假设有因变量 Y 和 100 个解释变量 X 的 500 期样本数据，我们想看看哪个 X 能够预测 Y。多重检验的步骤为：\n\n用每个 X 和 Y 回归（在我们的例子中就是 100 次回归），得到 100 个残差 OX，它们和 Y 正交。这构成了 null hypothesis：所有 OX 对 Y 没有预测性。\n\n以这 500 期的 Y 和正交化得到的 OX 为原始数据（500 × 101 的矩阵，每一行代表一期，第一列为 Y，第二到第 101 列为 100 个 OX 变量），使用带放回的 Bootstrap 重采样从这 500 行中不断的随机抽取，构建和原始长度一样的 bootstrapped 数据（也是 500 × 101 矩阵）。整行抽取保留了这 100 个变量在截面上的相关性。此外 Bootstrap 的好处是不对原始数据中的概率分布做任何假设。\n\n使用 bootstrapped 数据，用每个 OX 和 Y 回归得到一个检验统计量 (比如是 t-statistic); 找出所有 OX 中该检验统计量最大的那个值，称为 max statistic。如果我们的检验统计量是 t-statistic，那么这个 max statistic 就是 100 个 t-statistic 中最大的。\n重复上述第二、第三步 10000 次，得到 max statistic 的经验分布（empirical distribution），这是纯靠运气（因为 null hypothesis 已经是 OX 对 Y 没有任何预测性了）能够得到的 max statistic 的分布。\n比较原始数据 Y 和每个 X 回归得到的 max statistic 和第四步得到的 max statistic 的经验分布：\n如果来自真实数据的 max statistic 超过了经验分布中的阈值（比如 95% 显著性水平对应的经验分布中 max statistic 的取值），那么真实数据中 max statistic 对应的解释变量就是真正显著的。假设这个解释变量是 X_7。\n如果来自真实数据的 max statistic 没有超过经验分布中的阈值，则这 100 个解释变量全都是不显著的。本过程结束，无需继续进行。\n\n\n使用目前为止已被挑出来的全部显著解释变量对 Y 进行正交化，得到残差 OY。它是原始 Y 中这些变量无法解释的部分。\n使用 OY 来正交化剩余的 X（已经选出来显著变量，比如 X_7，不再参与余下的挑选过程）。\n重复上述第三步到第七步：反复使用已挑出的显著因子来正交化 Y，再用 OY 来正交化剩余解释变量 X；在 Bootstrap 重采样时，使用 OY、k 个已经选出的 X、和剩余 100 - k 个正交化后的 OX 作为原始数据生成 bootstrapped 样本；通过大量的 Bootstrap 实验得到新的 max statistic 的经验分布，并判断剩余解释变量中是否仍然有显著的。\n当剩余解释变量的 max statistic 无法超过 null hypothesis 下 max statistic 的经验分布阈值时，整个过程结束，剩余的解释变量全都是不显著的。\n\n3. t-statistics Threshold using Multiple Testing\n\nHarvey, Campbell R., Yan Liu, and Heqing Zhu. \"… and the cross-section of expected returns.\" The Review of Financial Studies 29, no. 1 (2016): 5-68.\n\n3.1.

Paper summary\nt-statistics threshold\nThis paper studies many published factors using three adjustment methods previously introduced to the observed factor tests, under the assumption that the test results of all tried factors are available. They choose to set \\alpha at 5\\% (Bonferroni, Holm; FWER) and \\alpha at 1\\% (BHY; FDR) for the main results. \n\nFor Bonferroni, the benchmark t-statistic starts at 1.96 and increases to 3.78 by 2012. It reaches 4.00 in 2032. \nHolm tracks Bonferroni closely and their differences are small.\nBHY implied benchmarks, on the other hand, are not monotonic. They fluctuate before year 2000 and stabilize at 3.39 (p- value = 0.007) after 2010. Intuitively, at any fixed significance level \\alpha, the law of large numbers forces the false discovery rate (FDR) to converge to a constant. \nIf we change the \\alpha to 5\\% for BHY, the corresponding BHY implied benchmark t-statistic is 2.78 (p-value = 0.0054) in 2012 and 2.81 (p-value = 0.0005) in 2032, still much higher than the starting value of 1.96.\n\nNotice that the authors assume that the total number of tests equals the total number of discoveries. If there are any unpublished factors, they will only increase the t-statistics threshold. Therefore, the above t-statistics discussed only gives a lower bound. \nSimulation with correlation structure\nThe authors also considers a simulation framework where the t-statistics for the i-th factor portfolio follows a normal distribution,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_{i} &=\\left(\\sum_{t=1}^{N} X_{i, t} / N\\right) /(\\sigma / \\sqrt{N}), \\\\\nT_{i} &\\sim N\\left(\\mu_{i} /(\\sigma / \\sqrt{N}), 1\\right), \\\\\n\\mu_{i} &\\sim p_{0} I_{\\{\\mu=0\\}}+\\left(1-p_{0}\\right) \\operatorname{Exp}(\\lambda).\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere I_{\\{\\mu=0\\}} in the prior distribution of mean \\mu_i is the distribution that has a point mass at zero. \nThey also incorporate cross-sectional correlations among contemporaneous returns. To overcome the missing data problem, they assume that their sample covers a fraction r of t-statistics in between 1.96 and 2.57 and that all t-statistics above 2.57 are covered.\nThe quantities they choose to match and their values for the baseline sample are given by:\n\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\widehat{T}=\\text { Total number of discoveries }=353, \\\\\n\\widehat{Q}_{1}=\\text { The } 20 \\text { th percentile of the sample of } t \\text {-statistics }=2.39, \\\\\n\\widehat{Q}_{2}=\\text { The } 50 \\text { th percentile of the sample of } t \\text {-statistics }=3.16, \\\\\n\\widehat{Q}_{3}=\\text { The } 90 \\text { th percentile of the sample of } t \\text {-statistics }=6.34 .\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\nThe estimation works by seeking to find the set of parameters that minimizes the following objective function:\n\nD\\left(\\lambda, p_{0}, M, \\rho\\right)=w_{0}(T-\\widehat{T})^{2}+\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_{i}\\left(Q_{i}-\\widehat{Q}_{i}\\right)^{2}.\n\nTheir simulation results is given in the table below.\n\nTo conclude, a new factor needs to clear a much higher hurdle, with a t-statistic greater than 3.0.\n4. Bayesian Approach\n\n在追逐 p-value 的道路上狂奔，却在科学的道路上渐行渐远\n\nHarvey, Campbell R. \"Presidential address: The scientific outlook in financial economics.\" The Journal of Finance 72, no. 4 (2017): 1399-1440.\n\n\nThe MBF is the lower bound among all Bayes factors. It occurs when the density of the prior distribution of alternative hypotheses concentrates at the maximum likelihood estimate of the data.\nThe definition of Bayes factor K is given by\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nK &= \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid H_{0}\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid H_{1}\\right)} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\int \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\theta_{0} \\mid H_{0}\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid \\theta_{0}, H_{0}\\right) d \\theta_{0}}{\\int \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid H_{1}\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid \\theta_{1}, H_{1}\\right) d \\theta_{1}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_{0} \\mid D\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}(D)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_{0}\\right)}}{\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_{1} \\mid D\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}(D)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_{1}\\right)}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_{0} \\mid D\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_{1} \\mid D\\right)} \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_{1}\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_{0}\\right)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\nFrom the integral expression, the Bayes factor still depends on the prior specification of the alternative hypotheses (the density of \\theta_1 under the alternative). However, we can define the minimum Bayes factor (MBF), which can bypass this problem and the MBF is the lower bound among all Bayes factors. \nThe MBF occurs when the density of the prior distribution of alternative hypotheses concentrates at the maximum likelihood estimate of the data. From the above definition and equivalences, we have\n\nK = \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid H_{0}\\right)}{\\int \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid H_{1}\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid \\theta_{1}, H_{1}\\right) d \\theta_{1}} \\geq \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid H_{0}\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid \\theta_{1}^{\\mathrm{MLE}}, H_{1}\\right)} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(D \\mid H_{0}\\right)}{\\mathcal{L}\\left(D \\mid \\theta_{1}^{\\mathrm{MLE}}, H_{1}\\right)}.\n\n Here \\theta_1^{\\mathrm{MLE}} is the maximum likelihood estimator under alternative. \nNotice that by Bayes Theorem, the posterior probability is given by\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Pr}(H_0 \\mid D)\n&=\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}(D \\mid H_0) \\operatorname{Pr}(H_0)}{\\operatorname{Pr}(D)} \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}(D \\mid H_0) \\operatorname{Pr}(H_0)}{\\operatorname{Pr}(D \\mid H_0) \\operatorname{Pr}(H_0) + \\operatorname{Pr}(D \\mid H_1) \\operatorname{Pr}(H_1)} \\\\\n&=\\frac{K \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}(H_0)}{\\operatorname{Pr}(H_1)}}{1 + K \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}(H_0)}{\\operatorname{Pr}(H_1)}} =\\frac{K \\frac{\\pi_0}{\\pi_1}}{1 + K \\frac{\\pi_0}{\\pi_1}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\nHere \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 are the prior of null and alternative hypothesis respectively. If we replace the Bayes factor K by its lower bound, the minimum Bayes factor (MBF), we obtain an lower bound of the posterior probability, \n\n\\operatorname{Pr}(H_0 \\mid D) \\geq \\frac{MBF \\times \\frac{\\pi_0}{\\pi_1}}{1 + MBF \\times \\frac{\\pi_0}{\\pi_1}}.\n\n5.

High Dimensional Learning\n\nMartin, Ian WR, and Stefan Nagel. \"Market efficiency in the age of big data.\" Journal of Financial Economics (2021).\n\nFalse In-Sample Predictability?\n\n\nRational Expectation\nIf investors knew the coefficients of the predictive model, they could form expectations of cash-flow growth, and hence price assets, in such a way that returns would not be predictable in the cross-section. This is the conventional rational expectations (RE) equilibrium that is the foundation for typical market efficiency tests. Similarly, if the parameter dimension d is small relative to N (the number of individual stocks), investors could estimate the parameters of their cash-flow forecasting model with great precision, leading to asset prices that are close to those in the RE equilibrium.\nHigh-dimensional Learning\n从直观上来理解，这是因为投资者高维学习问题会导致均衡状态下资产的价格和理性预期情况下相比出现偏差；该偏差的存在将造成事后（ex post）从计量经济学家的视角来看，已实现收益率不再随机，而是包含了一部分可预测的成分；因此当人们事后用统计检验分析变量和收益率的关系时，会误以为某些变量对收益率有预测性。在作者的假设中，参数向量 g 满足多元正态分布：\n\ng \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{\\theta}{J} I_{J}\\right), \\; \\; g \\in \\mathbb{R}^J.\n\n其中 \\theta 是一个常数, I_{J} 是 J 阶单位矩阵。这个假设的核心是 g 的方差和 J (变量的个数) 成反比。它对模型尽可能贴合现实世界至关重要。这是因为上述假设保证了无论 J 怎么变，模型中的信噪比都是不变的。如果没有这个约束，则随着使用的变量越来越多， r_{t+1} 中可解释的部分将会越来越大，远超过噪音 e_{t}，这显然是不切实际的。以上就是关于资产基本面的建模。在这个假设下，J 相当于股票数量变大会使得估计产生不可忽略的误差，从而偏离理性预期模型。\n2. 因子样本外表现为什么变差？\n\n因子样本外表现为什么变差？\n\n造成因子样本内、外表现差异的最主要原因自然是样本内的 data snooping (即因子本来就是假的)，但如果因子确实是真实的，那么它们在样本外变差的原因是什么呢？学术界和业界的主要观点包括以下三种：\n\n曝光导致错误定价减弱\n因子拥挤\n交易成本\n\n2.1. 曝光对定价的修正\n\nMcLean, R. David, and Jeffrey Pontiff. \"Does academic research destroy stock return predictability?.\" The Journal of Finance 71, no. 1 (2016): 5-32.\n\nBowles, Boone, Adam V. Reed, Matthew C. Ringgenberg, and Jacob R. Thornock. \"Anomaly time.\" Available at SSRN 3069026 (2020).\n\n\nMcLean and Pontiff (2016) 研究了 97 个因子，发现因子样本外的表现比样本内的表现下降了 26%、而发表后 (post-publication) 的表现较样本内则下降了 58%。McLean and Pontiff (2016) 考虑样本内外差异是为了控制过拟合的影响。上述结果表明，58% 与 26% 之差 —— 即 32% —— 就是发表本身造成因子效果的减弱。McLean and Pontiff (2016) 把它称作 publication-informed trading。这背后的逻辑链是：\n​    因子被发表导致它被公布于众 --> 越来越多的人交易该因子从而减弱了错误定价 --> 最终导致因子收益率降低\n学术界在研究因子的时候为了避免未来数据，通常采用每年再平衡的方法 (量价相关的指标通常是月频再平衡)，导致构建因子的指标数据严重滞后。Bowles et al. (2019) 一文则使用 Compustat Snapshot 数据库对因子时效进行了分析。利用 Snapshot 数据，Bowles et al. (2019) 研究了一些常见的源自财务数据的因子，发现绝大多数因子在最新数据更新后的 120 天之内 (特别是最初的 30 天内) 能够获得显著的超额收益。而在 120 天之后，超额收益消失。不过，Bowles et al. (2019) 也指出，最近几年的实证结果显示，因子的超额收益消失的更快。基于这些发现，Bowles et al. (2019) 认为因子是真实的 (而非 data snooping 出来的)，但很快就会因套利交易而消失。\n2.2. 因子拥挤\n\nBonne, George, Leon Roisenberg, Roman Kouzmenko, and Peter Zangari. \"MSCI integrated factor crowding model.\" (2020).\nBayraktar, M., Stuart Doole, Altaf Kassam, and Stan Radchenko. \"Lost in the Crowd?
