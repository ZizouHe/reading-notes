Summary\n\nMemory efficiency: Not storing any intermediate quantities of the forward pass allows us to train our models with constant memory cost as a function of depth, a major bottleneck of training deep models.\n\nAdaptive computation: Modern ODE solvers provide guarantees about the growth of approximation error, monitor the level of error, and adapt their evaluation strategy on the fly to achieve the requested level of accuracy. This allows the cost of evaluating a model to scale with problem complexity.\n\nParameter efficiency: When the hidden unit dynamics are parameterized as a continuous function of time, the parameters of nearby “layers” are automatically tied together which reduces the number of parameters required on a supervised learning task.\n\nScalable and invertible normalizing flows: the change of variables formula becomes easier to compute therefore it can avoid the single-unit bottleneck of normalizing flows, and can be trained directly by maximum likelihood.\n\n\n2. Feedforward structure\nThis paper introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of a series of discrete hidden layer, as\n\n\\mathbf { h } _ { t + 1 } = \\mathbf { h } _ { t } + f \\left( \\mathbf { h } _ { t } , \\theta _ { t } \\right)\n\nthe deep neural network can be parameterized by a continuous dynamics of hidden units using an ordinary differential equation scheme\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { h } ( t ) } { d t } = f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta )\n\nTherefore, the traditional network can be seen as this function f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ). And the feedforward step can be solved by a black-box differential equation solver.\n3. Backpropogate scheme\nThe backpropogation step is as follows. Consider the loss function,\n\nL \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 1 } \\right) \\right) = L \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 0 } \\right) + \\int _ { t _ { 0 } } ^ { t _ { 1 } } f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) d t \\right) = L \\left( \\operatorname { ODESolve } \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 0 } \\right) , f , t _ { 0 } , t _ { 1 } , \\theta \\right) \\right)\n\nUsing adjoint sensitivity method,\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { a } ( t ) } { d t } = - \\mathbf { a } ( t ) ^ { \\top } \\frac { \\partial f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) } { \\partial \\mathbf { h } }, \\;\\; \\text{where} \\; \\mathbf { a } ( t ) = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf { h } ( t )}\n\nthis can be solved by a ODE solver once we know \\mathbf{h}(t) for any t_0 \\leq t \\leq t_1. This can be done by using a ODE solver of\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { h } ( t ) } { d t } = f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta )\n\nwith initial value \\mathbf{h}(t_1). With the knowledge of \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf { h } ( t )}, the gradient can be obtained by\n\n\\frac { d L } { d \\theta } = - \\int _ { t _ { 1 } } ^ { t _ { 0 } } \\mathbf { a } ( t ) ^ { \\top } \\frac { \\partial f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) } { \\partial \\theta } d t\n\nstill can be done by a ODE solver. All integrals for solving \\mathbf{h}, \\mathbf{a} and \\partial L / \\partial \\theta  can be computed in a single call to an ODE solver, which concatenates the original state, the adjoint, and the other partial derivatives into a single vector. Therefore, each step in the ODE solver, once we get \\mathbf{h}(t), we can therefore obtain \\mathbf{a}(t) and afterwards, the gradient.\n"},"notes/RDN.html":{"url":"notes/RDN.html","title":"Relational Dependency Networks","keywords":"","body":" Relational Dependency Networks1.

Journal of Machine Learning Research, 8(Mar), 653-692.\n\nRelational Machine Learning Library (RMLLib)\n\n\n1. Summary\nModel the data using the idea of relational database and consider the autocorrelation between instances. The learning algorithm is novel, learning the CPDs based on the query that can return local sub-graphs. The learning algorithm can also produce dependency which interprets the relation between attributes. The inference process utilize the Gibbs sampler. However, it does not have the property like Markov network that the product of CPD is indeed the joint distribution, which is a trade-off between theoretical guarantee and cyclical network that describe wider connection between attributes.\n2. Structure of the network\nInstead of consider independent instance case, RDN consider there are dependency (autocorrelation) among instances and therefore construct a whole large graph connected all instances (by connecting their attributes).\nThe relational data set is represented as a typed, attributed data graph G_D = (V_D,E_D). Consider the data graph in Figure 1(a). The nodes V_D represent objects in the data (e.g.,\nauthors, papers) and the edges E_D represent relations among the objects (e.g., author-of, cites). Each node v_i \\in V_D and edge e_j \\in E_D is associated with a type, T(v_i) = t_{v_i} and T(e_j) = t_{e_j} (e.g., paper, cited-by). Each item type t \\in T has a number of associated attributes \\boldsymbol{X}^t = (X^1_t , ..., X_m^t) (e.g., topic, year). Consequently, each object v_i and link e_j is associated with a set of attribute values\ndetermined by their type, \\boldsymbol{X}_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}} = (X_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}1} , \\ldots, X_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}m}) and \\boldsymbol{X}_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}} = (X_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}1} , \\ldots, X_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}m'}). A PRM represents a joint distribution over the values of the attributes in the data graph,\n\n\\boldsymbol{x}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}}^{\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}}}:v_{i} \\in V \\text{ s.t. }T(v_{i})=t_{v_{i}}\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\boldsymbol{e}_{j}}^{\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\boldsymbol{e}_{\\boldsymbol{j}}}}:e_{j} \\in E \\text{ s.t. } T(e_{j})=t_{e_{j}} \\right\\}\n\nFigure 1. Example (a) data graph and (b) model graph.\nThe network is represented by the product of conditional probability distributions (CPD) of one node given its parents. There are a few things need to be clarified:\n\nSince RDN is a cyclical graph, the product of CPD does not necessarily be the joint distribution, but under some conditions, it is quite close to the joint one.\n\nIn practice, the parents of one node is not given exhaustedly, moreover, we use query from relational database to return a local network for each node and condition on them.\n\nMany machine learning algorithms can reveal the dependency of the variables, i.e. from the local network queried, to select the nodes that are parents of one node.\n\n\n2.1. RDN learning\nThe pseudo-likelihood for data graph G_D is computed as a product over the item types t, the attributes of that type X_t, and the items of that type v,e:\n\nPL\\left(G_{D} ; \\theta\\right) = \\prod_{t \\in T} \\prod_{X_{i}^{t}\\in \\mathbf{X}^{t}}\\prod_{v:T(v)=t} p\\left(x_{v_i}^{t} | pa_{x_{v_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\\prod_{e:T(e)=t}p\\left(x_{e_i}^{t}|pa_{x_{e_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\n\nhere \\theta may not be an explicit set of parameters, but implicit structure like tree. Therefore, we can maximize CPD for every node to maximize pseudo-likelihood:\n\n\\prod_{v:T(v)=t} p\\left(x_{v_i}^{t} | pa_{x_{v_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right) \\; \\text{and} \\; \\prod_{e:T(e)=t}p\\left(x_{e_i}^{t}|pa_{x_{e_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\n\nusing some learners like Relational Bayesian Classifiers as well as Relational Probability Trees. After we maximize the pseudo-likelihood, we also learn the dependency among the nodes, like model graph in Figure 1(b).\n2.2. RDN inference\nFor some unknown nodes, we can use Gibbs sampling to make the inference. We first assign all unknown nodes a prior probability and draw from this prior distribution. Then, for each unknown node, we can randomly draw one sample from its CPD we have learned above. The empirical marginal and joint distribution can be calculated from the samples we draw from the Gibbs sampler.\nFigure 2.

Summary\nThis paper presents a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model with topics as latent variable. The parameter estimation and inference tasks can be made via a combination of variational method and EM algorithm.\n2. Structure\nWe define:\n\nA word is the basic unit of discrete data, defined to be an item from a vocabulary indexed by \\{1, .\\ldots , V \\}. We encode words with one-hot coding.\nA document is a sequence of N words denoted by \\mathbf{w} = (w_1,w_2, \\ldots ,w_N), where w_n is the nth word in the sequence.\nA corpus is a collection of M documents denoted by \\mathbf{D} = \\{\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2, \\ldots , \\mathbf{w}_M\\}.\n\nLDA assumes the following generative process for each document \\mathbf{w} in a corpus \\mathbf{D}:\n\nChoose N \\sim \\operatorname{Poisson}(\\xi).\nChoose \\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Dir}(\\alpha). The dimension of this Dirichlet distribution is assumed known and fixed.\nFor each of the N words w_n:\n (a) Choose a topic z_{n} \\sim \\text { Multinomial }(\\theta).\n (b) Choose a word w_n from p\\left(w_{n} | z_{n}, \\beta\\right), a multinomial probability conditioned on the topic z_n.\n\nBasically, we allocate the multinomial probability of k latent topics using hyper-parameter \\alpha and then sample each word from the sampled multinomial distribution.\n\nFigure 1: Graphical model representation of LDA. The boxes are \"plates\" representing replicates. The outer plate represents documents, while the inner plate represents the repeated choice of topics and words within a document.\nTherefore, we can obtain the marginal distribution of a document:\n\np(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)=\\int p(\\theta | \\alpha)\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\sum_{z_{n}} p\\left(z_{n} | \\theta\\right) p\\left(w_{n} | z_{n}, \\beta\\right)\\right) d \\theta\n\nThe probability of a corpus given parameter \\alpha, \\beta is\n\np(\\mathbf{D} | \\alpha, \\beta) =\\prod_{d=1}^{M} \\int p\\left(\\theta_{d} | \\alpha\\right)\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{N_{d}} \\sum_{z_{d n}} p\\left(z_{d n} | \\theta_{d}\\right) p\\left(w_{d n} | z_{d n}, \\beta\\right)\\right) d \\theta_{d}\n\n3. Learning and Inference\nThe key inferential problem that we need to solve in order to use LDA is that of computing the posterior distribution of the hidden variables given a document:\n\np(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{w}, \\alpha, \\beta)=\\frac{p(\\theta, \\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)}{p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)}\n\nwhich is intractable because of the intractability of p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta). We consider using a variational inference method to approximate this posterior distribution:\n\nq(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\gamma, \\phi)=q(\\theta | \\gamma) \\prod_{n=1}^{N} q\\left(z_{n} | \\phi_{n}\\right)\n\nAs for the learning task, we wish to find parameters \\alpha and \\beta that maximize the (marginal) log likelihood of the data:\n\n\\ell(\\alpha, \\beta)=\\sum_{d=1}^{M} \\log p\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{d} | \\alpha, \\beta\\right)\n\nsince p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta) is intractable, We can thus find approximate empirical Bayes estimates for the LDA model via an alternating variational EM procedure that maximizes a lower bound with respect to the variational parameters \\gamma and \\phi, and then, for fixed values of the variational parameters, maximizes the lower bound with respect to the model parameters \\alpha and \\beta:\n\n(E-step) For each document, find the optimizing values of the variational parameters \\left\\{\\gamma_{d}^{*}, \\phi_{d}^{*} :d \\in \\mathbf{D} \\right\\}. This minimization can be achieved via an iterative fixed-point method.\n\n\n\\left(\\gamma^{*}, \\phi^{*}\\right)=\\arg \\min _{(\\gamma, \\phi)} \\mathrm{D}(q(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\gamma, \\phi) \\| p(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{w}, \\alpha, \\beta))\n\n\n(M-step) Maximize the resulting lower bound on the log likelihood with respect to the model parameters \\alpha and \\beta.

Any class of distributions that allows such a compression scheme can also be learned with few samples. Furthermore, if a class of distributions has such a compression scheme, then so do the classes of products and mixtures of those distributions.\n2. Definition\nDefinition.

We say \\mathcal{F} admits (\\tau, t, m) r-robust compression if there exists a decoder \\mathcal{J} for \\mathcal{F} such that for any distribution g \\in \\mathcal{F}, and for any distribution q on Z with \\|g-q\\|_{1} \\leq r, the following holds:\nFor any \\varepsilon \\in(0,1), if a sample S is drawn from q^{m(\\varepsilon) \\log 1 / \\delta}, then with probability at least 1 - \\delta, there exists a sequence L of at most \\tau(\\varepsilon) elements of S, and a sequence B of at most t(\\varepsilon) bits, such that \\|\\mathcal{J}(L, B)-g\\|_{1} \\leq \\varepsilon\nNote that here q can be seen as a corrupted version of real distribution g, and the data is drawn from this corrupted one. And here L and B are sequences therefore can contain repeated elements. Essentially, the definition asserts that with probability 2/3, there is a (short) sequence of elements S and some (small number of) additional bits, from which g can be approximately reconstructed.\nTheorem. There exists a deterministic algorithm that, given candidate distributions f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{M}, a parameter \\varepsilon>0 and \\log \\left(3 M^{2} / \\delta\\right) / 2 \\varepsilon^{2} i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution g, outputs an index j \\in[M] such that\n\n\\left\\|f_{j}-g\\right\\|_{1} \\leq 3 \\min _{i \\in[M]}\\left\\|f_{i}-g\\right\\|_{1}+4 \\varepsilon\n\nwith probability at least 1-\\delta/3.\nNotice that although one decoder cannot know the real set of L and B, it does know the finite length of L and B as a function of \\epsilon.

In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 2917-2925).\n\nFor an introduction to MCMC, see my notes/Monte Carlo Sampling.\n\n\n1. Summary\nIn this paper, a complete framework to direct the MCMC samplers has been presented. It shows that this framework is sufficient and necessary for all MCMC samplers. As many recent work try to use stochastic gradient version MCMC samplers as a consideration of computation, this method mainly introduce a systematical way to guide SGMCMC. Based on this framework, a new MCMC sampler called stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC) has also been introduced\n2. A Stochastic Gradient MCMC Framework\nIn general, we can write all continuous Markov processes as the following form stochastic differential equation:\n\r\n\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{z}= f(\\mathbf{z}) \\mathrm{d} t+ \\sqrt{2 \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z})} \\mathrm{d} \\mathrm{W}(t)\r\n\nwhere f(\\mathbf{z}) denotes the deterministic drift and \\mathrm{W}(t) is a d-dimensional Wiener Process, and D(\\mathbf{z}) is a positive semi-definite diffusion matrix. Notice that only some choices of f(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) yields a stationary distribution with the form p^s(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp^{-H(\\mathbf{z})}. Here H(\\mathbf{z}) is related to Hamiltonian MC as well as other MCMC algorithms.\nThis paper proposes to write f(\\mathbf{z}) into the following form:\n\r\n\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{z})=-[\\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z})+\\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z})] \\nabla H(\\mathbf{z})+\\Gamma(\\mathbf{z}), \\quad \\mathrm{P}_{i}(\\mathbf{z})=\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{z}_{j}}\\left(\\mathrm{D}_{i j}(\\mathbf{z})+\\mathrm{Q}_{i j}(\\mathbf{z})\\right)\r\n\nHere \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) is a skew-symmetric curl matrix representing the deterministic traversing effects seen in HMC procedures. In contrast, the diffusion matrix \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) determines the strength of the Wiener-process-driven diffusion. Matrices \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) can be adjusted to attain faster convergence to the posterior distribution.\nIt is stated that if we specifically write f(\\mathbf{z}) into the above form, then the stationary distribution of SDE has the form of p^s(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp^{-H(\\mathbf{z})}. Moreover, if the stationary distribution of SDE uniquely exists, then there exists skew-symmetric curl matrix \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) such that we can write f(\\mathbf{z}) in the SDE to our specified form, and therefore the stationary distribution has our desired form.\n3. Practical Algorithms and Discussions\n3.1. \\varepsilon-discretization Update\nIn practice, we choose a step size of \\varepsilon and update using the following discretized form of SDE:\n\r\n\\mathbf{z}_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\epsilon_{t}\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\mathrm{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\nabla H\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\Gamma\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right]+\\mathcal{N}\\left(0,2 \\epsilon_{t} \\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right)\r\n\nIn the above step, instead of evaluating the gradient using full data, we can use part of the data to do a stochastic-gradient-descent-style update in order to achieve computation efficiency. Although this SG step is unbiased, it does introduce extra noise into the training procedure. It can be shown that this noise is asymptotically normal, and we can partly subtract this noise by\n\r\n\\mathbf{z}_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\epsilon_{t}\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\mathrm{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\nabla \\widetilde{H}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\Gamma\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right]+\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\epsilon_{t}\\left(2 \\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)-\\epsilon_{t} \\hat{\\mathrm{B}}_{t}\\right)\\right)\r\n\nwhere \\widetilde{H}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right) is the down-sampled version of gradient and \\hat{\\mathrm{B}}_{t} is our estimated noise term. It is also true that this SGD-correction training procedure also yields the correct invariant distribution.\n3.2. Construct Samplers with Proposed Framework\nThe authors shows that all previous MCMC methods, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC), Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) as well as Stochastic Gradient Riemannian Langevin Dynamics (SGRLD) are all adapted to this framework.\nSince the matrices \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) can be adjusted, a new sampler called Stochastic Gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC) has been presented which introduces Fisher information metric as a way to utilize the geometry information of our targeted distribution.

Sharp minima can generalize for deep nets. In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70 (pp. 1019-1028).\n\n1. Summary\nThis paper criticizes some previous definitions of sharpness (for the local minima of loss function) to be unsuitable under the settings of deep neural networks. However, this phenomenon is because the loss function of deep neural networks typically cannot guarantee the positive definite property of Hessian matrix around local minima and those definitions of sharpness usually require some assumptions include positive definite Hessian and smoothness to guarantee the generalization property.\n2. Proof using Re-parameterization Tricks\nDeep neural network has the issue of over-parameterization. Consider a one-hidden layer network, \\boldsymbol{y} = \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x} \\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}) \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2} with ReLU as activation function \\sigma(\\cdot), a transformation T_\\alpha(\\cdot) on the parameter space (\\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2}) is\n\nT_\\alpha(\\cdot): (\\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2}) \\rightarrow (\\alpha \\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\alpha^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2})\n\nThis transformation can be extended to deeper networks and convolution layer can also be included. For the sharpness defined below,\nDefinition. Given \\varepsilon > 0, a minimum \\theta, and a loss L, we define C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon) as the largest (using inclusion as the partial order over the subsets of \\theta) connected set containing \\theta such that \\forall \\theta^\\prime \\in C(L,\\theta,\\varepsilon), L(\\theta′) . The \\varepsilon-flatness will be defined as the volume of C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon). We will call this measure the volume \\varepsilon-flatness.\nDefinition. Let \\mathcal{B}_2(\\varepsilon,\\theta) be an Euclidean ball centered on a minimum \\theta with radius \\varepsilon. Then, for a non-negative valued loss function L, the \\varepsilon-sharpness will be defined as proportional to\n\n\\frac{\\max _{\\theta^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{2}(\\epsilon, \\theta)}\\left(L\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}\\right)-L(\\theta)\\right)}{1+L(\\theta)} \\approx \\frac{\\left|\\left\\|\\left(\\nabla^{2} L\\right)(\\theta)\\right\\|\\right|_{2} \\epsilon^{2}}{2(1+L(\\theta))}\n\nwe can use re-parameterization trick to get the result that for neural networks defined above, C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon) has infinite volume and \\varepsilon-sharpness can be arbitrarily large or small without changing the generalization power.\nMoreover, for any Hessian-based or Jacobian-based definition, it is not valid to be considered in deep neural networks settings.\n"},"notes/Sharpe_Minima_Exp.html":{"url":"notes/Sharpe_Minima_Exp.html","title":"Large Batch Training and Sharpe Minima","keywords":"","body":" On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima1.

Summary\nThis paper discusses the phenomenon the generalization gap (test error drop) for the large-batch SGD. It states that large-batch SGD training is more likely to converge to the sharp minima while the small-batch SGD converges to the flat minima, which is due to the inherent noise in the training.\n2. Generalization Gap for Large-batch\nEmpirically, large-batch SGD experience a drop in test error and by experiment, we can check that this is not caused by over-fitting. Another explanation could be sharpness, as in the lens of the minimum description length (MDL) theory, which states that statistical models that require fewer bits to describe generalize better. Since flat minima can be specified with lower precision than to sharp minima, they tend to have better generalization performance. Alternative theory of sharpness and generalization are presented through the Bayesian view of learning and the lens of free Gibbs energy.\n3. Sharpness and Explanation\nAs defined in the paper, let\n\n\\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p} :-\\epsilon\\left(\\left|\\left(A^{+} x\\right)_{i}\\right|+1\\right) \\leq z_{i} \\leq \\epsilon\\left(\\left|\\left(A^{+} x\\right)_{i}\\right|+1\\right) \\quad \\forall i \\in\\{1,2, \\cdots, p\\}\\right\\}\n\nwhere A^+ denotes the pseudo-inverse of A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p} and \\epsilon > 0 controls the size of the box. Therefore, we define the \\left(\\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}, A\\right)-sharpness of f at x as:\n\n\\phi_{x, f}(\\epsilon, A) :=\\frac{\\left(\\max _{y \\in \\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}} f(x+A y)\\right)-f(x)}{1+f(x)} \\times 100\n\nUsing the defined sharpness, the local minima found by large-batch method has larger sharpness than that found by small-batch empirically.\nAlthough they are all unbiased gradient estimators, large-batch has small variance which makes it more likely to be stuck in a sharp minima. However, as small-batch introduces much more noise, it has the property of exploration and therefore can avoid the trap of sharp minima. Large-batch methods lack this explorative properties of small-batch methods and tend to zoom-in on the minima closest to the initial point.\nHowever, this definition of sharpness is not very rigorous in a deep neural network setting, as will be shown in Sharp minima can generalize for deep nets.\n"},"notes/RMLHMC.html":{"url":"notes/RMLHMC.html","title":"Riemann Manifold Langevin and HMC","keywords":"","body":" Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods1.

Summary\nThis paper extend two MCMC algorithms: Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo from Euclidean space to Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. This is done by utilizing the geometry information associated with probability density function.\n2. Enlightenment from Metropolis Adjusted Langevin and HMC\n2.1. Metropolis Adjusted Langevin\nBased on a Langevin diffusion, the SDE with stationary distribution p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is\n\r\n\\mathrm{d} \\theta(t)=\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)\\} \\mathrm{d} t / 2+\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{b}(t)\r\n\nwhere \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\equiv \\log \\{p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\} and \\mathbf{b} denotes a D-dimensional Brownian motion. A first-order Euler discretization of the SDE gives the proposal mechanism\n\r\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}+\\varepsilon^{2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}\\right) / 2+\\varepsilon \\mathbf{z}^{n}\r\n\nwhere \\mathbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}) and \\epsilon is the integration step size. Notice that the error this discretization introduces can be corrected by employing a Metropolis acceptance probability after each integration step.\nAlthough the drift term in the proposal mechanism for the Metropolis Adjusted Langevin defines the direction for the proposal based on the gradient information, it is clear that the isotropic diffusion will be inefficient for strongly correlated variables \\boldsymbol{\\theta} with widely differing variances forcing the step size to accommodate the variate with smallest variance. This issue can be circumvented by employing a preconditioning matrix M such that\n\r\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}+\\varepsilon^{2} \\mathbf{M} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}\\right) / 2+\\varepsilon \\sqrt{\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{z}}^{n}\r\n\n2.2. HMC\nWith a auxiliary variable \\boldsymbol{p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{0}, M), we can define the negative joint log-probability as\n\r\nH(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\mathbf{p})=-\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})+\\frac{1}{2} \\log \\left\\{(2 \\pi)^{D}|\\mathbf{M}|\\right\\}+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{p}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{p}\r\n\nwhere the kinetic energy term \\mathbf{p}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{p} / 2 where the covariance matrix \\mathbf{M} denotes a mass matrix.\nIt can be shown that the discrete version of HMC (leapfrog method) is equivalent to a Metropolis Adjusted Langevin with precondition matrix \\mathbf{M}.\n3. Geometry Information in Probability\nA distance metric based on a first order expression for the symmetric Kullback-Liebler divergence between two densities p and q is defined as\n\r\nD_{\\mathcal{S}}(p \\| q)=D(p \\| q)+D(q \\| p)\r\n\nTherefore, up to a small term, we have\n\r\nD_{\\mathcal{S}}(p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}+\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\| p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})) = \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\top} E_{\\mathbf{y} | \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left\\{\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\log p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\log p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})^{\\top}\\right\\} \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\top} \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\r\n\nwhere \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is the Fisher Information matrix.\nThe parameter space of a statistical model is a Riemannian manifold. Therefore\nthe natural geometric structure of the density model p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is defined by the Riemannian manifold and associated metric tensor. Given this geometric structure of the parameter space of statistical models the appropriate adoption of the position specific metric, \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), within an MCMC scheme should yield more effective transitions in the overall algorithm.\n4. Manifold Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm\nGiven the geometric structure for probability models a Langevin diffusion with invariant measure p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) can be defined directly upon the Riemannian manifold with metric tensor \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}):\n\r\nd \\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)=\\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)) d t+d \\tilde{\\mathbf{b}}(t)\r\n\nwhere\n\r\n\\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))=\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)) \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))\r\n\nand\n\r\nd \\tilde{\\mathbf{b}}_{i}(t)=|\\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))|^{-1 / 2} \\sum_{j=1}^{D} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{j}}\\left(\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))_{i j}|\\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))|^{1 / 2}\\right) d t+\\left(\\sqrt{\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))} d \\mathbf{b}(t)\\right)_{i}\r\n\n5.

The shapes of the loss functions near the final solution differ across algorithms, and we trace this back to different algorithms selecting weight vectors with a consistent norm. Switching from one optimization algorithm to another late in training results in a final point characteristic of the second optimization algorithm. \nBatch normalization is key to obtaining this consistency in the projected loss surface.

Summary\nThis paper shows that given a discriminator objective, good semi-supervised learning indeed requires a bad generator, and propose the definition of a preferred generator.\n2. Problem Setups\nGiven a labeled set L = \\{(x, y)\\}, let \\{1, 2, \\cdots , K\\} be the label space for classification. Let D and G denote the discriminator and generator, and P_D and p_G denote the corresponding distributions. Consider the discriminator objective function of GAN-based semi-supervised learning, (this is the standard objective function for GAN-based semi-supervised learning)\n\n\\max _{D} \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{L}} \\log P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K)+\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p} \\log P_{D}(y \\leq K | x)+\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{G}} \\log P_{D}(K+1 | x)\n\nwhere P is the true data distribution. The probability distribution P_D is over K + 1 classes where the first K classes are true classes and the (K + 1)-th class is the fake class. The objective function consists of three terms. The first term is to maximize the log conditional probability for labeled data, which is the standard cost as in supervised learning setting. The second term is to maximize the log probability of the first K classes for unlabeled data. The third term is to maximize the log probability of the (K + 1)-th class for generated data.\nLet f(x) be a nonlinear vector-valued function, and w_k be the weight vector for class k. The discriminator D can be defined as\n\nP_{D}(k | x)=\\frac{\\exp \\left(w_{k}^{\\top} f(x)\\right)}{\\sum_{k^{\\prime}=1}^{K+1} \\exp \\left(w_{k^{\\prime}}^{\\top} f(x)\\right)}\n\nSince this is a form of over-parameterization, w_{K+1} is fixed as a zero vector.\n3. Perfect generator\nTheorem. If the generator distribution p_G matches the truen data distribution p, i.e. p_G = p, and discriminator D has infinite capacity, then for any optimal solution D = (w,f) of the following supervised objective,\n\n\\max _{D} \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{L}} \\log P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K)\n\nthere exists D^* = (w^*, f^*) such that D^* maximizes the semi-supervised cost function and that for all x, P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K) = P_{D^*}(y | x, y \\leq K).\nThis theorem states that given a perfect generator, there is no benefit for introducing the unlabeled data, i.e. the discriminator cannot improved by unsupervised part.\n4. Complement generator\nThe function f maps data points in the input space to the feature space. Let p_k(f) be the density of the data points of class k in the feature space. Given a threshold \\epsilon_k, let F_k be a subset of the data support where p_{k}(f)>\\epsilon_{k}, i.e., F_{k}=\\left\\{f : p_{k}(f)>\\epsilon_{k}\\right\\}. We assume that given \\left\\{\\epsilon_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{K}, the F_k’s are disjoint with a margin.\nSuppose \\cup_{k=1}^{K} F_{k} is bounded by a convex set \\mathcal{B}. If the support F_G of a generator G in the feature space is a relative complement set in \\mathcal{B}, i.e., F_{G}=\\mathcal{B}-\\cup_{k=1}^{K} F_{k}, we call G a complement generator.\nThen the paper states that when G is a complement generator, under mild assumptions, a near- optimal D learns correct decision boundaries in each high-density subset F_k (defined by \\epsilon_k) of the data support in the feature space. Intuitively, the generator generates complement samples so the logits of the true classes are forced to be low in the complement. As a result, the discriminator obtains class boundaries in low-density areas.\n5. Pros and cons of feature matching\nBy matching the first-order moment by SGD, feature matching is performing some kind of distribution matching, though in a rather weak manner. Loosely speaking, feature matching has the effect of generating samples close to the manifold. But due to its weak power in distribution matching, feature matching will inevitably generate samples outside of the manifold, especially when the data complexity increases. Consequently, the generator density p_G is usually lower than the true data density p within the manifold and higher outside. Hence, an optimal discriminator P_{D^*} (K+1 | x)=p(x) /\\left(p(x)+p_{G}(x)\\right) could still distinguish between true and generated samples in many cases.\n"},"notes/Faster_Frank_Wolfe.html":{"url":"notes/Faster_Frank_Wolfe.html","title":"Faster Rates for Frank-Wolfe over Strongly-Convex Sets","keywords":"","body":" Faster Rates for the Frank-Wolfe Method over Strongly-Convex Sets1.

They also show that various balls induced by l_p norms, Schatten norms and group norms are strongly convex on one hand and on the other hand, linear optimization over these sets is straightforward and admits a closed-form solution.\n2. Frank-Wolfe method\nThe Frank-Wolfe method, originally introduced by Frank and Wolfe in the 1950's, is a first order method for the minimization of a smooth convex function over a convex set. Compared to projection method, which is also a first order method on convex set, Frank-Wolfe method is projection free. Its main advantage in large-scale problems is that this projection-free characteristic makes computation efficient. First order and projection-free features enabled the derivation of algorithms that are practical on one hand and come with provable convergence rates on the other.\nFigure 1. Frank-Wolfe Algorithm\nAbove is the general Frank-Wolfe method, where \\mathcal{K} \\subset E is the convex feasible set and \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathcal{K}}(c), c \\in E returns a point x=\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathcal{K}}(c) \\in \\mathcal{K} such that x \\in \\arg \\min _{y \\in \\mathcal{K}} \\langle y, c \\rangle.

Chapter 5 The Efficient Portfolios and CAPM\n1.1. With Risk-free asset\nOptimize allocation factor using Markowitz's mean-variance optimization, which is equivalent to optimize the expected utility under exponential utility. Notice that the risk-free asset here can be used to eliminate the constraint of weights sum to one.\nFor any optimal solutions, they have the same Sharpe ratio, therefore the efficient frontier is a line with slope=optimal Sharpe ratio and intercept the risk-free rate.\nFigure 1. Efficient Frontier with risk-free asset\nIt can be shown that the market portfolio (with market value-weighted allocation vector) is on the efficient frontier and by two fund separation theorem, any efficient portfolio can be decomposed into the market portfolio and the risk-free one.\nCAPM: For the excess return Y of any portfolio, denote Y^m as the excess return of market portfolio, we have\n\nY = \\beta Y^m + \\epsilon, \\; \\; \\beta = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(Y, Y^m)}{\\mathrm{Var}(Y^m)}\n\nand \\epsilon is the external noise.\nThe CAPM model can be validated using\n\nEconometrics: regression and hypothesis testing\nMaximum likelihood estimation with Wald test or likelihood ratio test.\n\n1.2. Without Risk-free asset\nWe need to solve a constraint version of Markowitz's mean-variance optimization problem. It is also not hard using Lagrangian. This time, the efficient frontier is a parabola.\nFigure 2. Efficient Frontier without risk-free asset\nFor any portfolio on the frontier, you can find another one on the frontier that has zero beta with the previous one. The CAPM model is similarly formulated using one portfolio (as market portfolio) and its excess return is compared using its zero-beta counterparts (as risk-free one).\n2. Chapter 6 Factor Pricing Models\n2.1. Multi-factor models\nThe multi-factor model with return \\boldsymbol{R}, factor loading matrix \\boldsymbol{B}, factor \\boldsymbol{f} and external noise \\epsilon,\n\n\\boldsymbol{R} = \\boldsymbol{a} + \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\nThe multi-factor pricing model with expected return \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{R}], risk-free return \\gamma_0,\n\n\\boldsymbol{R} = \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1} + \\boldsymbol{B} (\\boldsymbol{f} - \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1}) + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\; \\; \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1} + \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_k\n\nwhere \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_k = \\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{f}] - \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1} is the excess return of factors. Using multi-factor pricing model, we can estimate the covariance matrix of return \\boldsymbol{R} with fewer parameters:\n\n\\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{R}) = \\boldsymbol{B}\\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{f}) \\boldsymbol{B}^\\top + \\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\n\nNotice that multi-factor model is always valid since this is a statistical decomposition (P245) but multi-factor pricing model needs to be validated.\n2.2. Validate multi-factor pricing model\nIf there is a risk-free asset, the multi-factor pricing model can be formed as\n\n\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\boldsymbol{a} + \\boldsymbol{B} (\\boldsymbol{f} - \\gamma_0 \\boldsymbol{1}) + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\nwhere \\boldsymbol{Y} is the excess return of all asset and the hypothesis test is simply,\n\nH_0: \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = 0\n\nIf there is not a risk-free asset, we need to compare multi-factor model with multi-factor pricing model and the hypothesis test is,\n\nH_0: \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\gamma_0 \\left(\\boldsymbol{1} - \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{1}\\right)\n\nBoth test can be done using a likelihood ratio test where \\boldsymbol{B}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_k (and \\gamma_0 in the risk-free absence case) can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation iteratively if we assume the residual \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} has a normal distribution.\nIf we use macroeconomic factors, whose excess return cannot be observed, we can estimate \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_k using MLE and change the hypothesis test accordingly.\n2.3. PCA and factor analysis\nFor the multi-factor pricing model, if we assume the residual covariance matrix is identity matrix, then it can be shown that the solution of MLE is the same as PCA results. \\boldsymbol{B} and the first K principal component of sample covariance matrix of return \\boldsymbol{R} span the same subspace.\nWhen the portfolio size is large, the PCA and factor analysis are approximately the same. See Fan, Liao and Mincheva (2013).\n3. Chapter 7 Portfolio Allocation and Risk Assessment\n3.1. Risk approximation\nFor any portfolio allocation vector \\boldsymbol{w}, we define the gross exposure c of the portfolio as c = \\| \\boldsymbol{w} \\|_1. Therefore,\n\n\\boldsymbol{w}^+ = \\sum_{w_i \\geq 0} w_i = \\frac{c+1}{2}, \\; \\; \\boldsymbol{w}^- = \\sum_{w_i \nThe variance of this portfolio is\n\nR(\\boldsymbol{w}) = w^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} =  \\boldsymbol{w}, \\; \\; \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{R})\n\nwith estimated covariance matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}, the empirical risk is\n\n\\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w}) = \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w}\n\nFor any portfolio with allocation vector \\boldsymbol{w},\n\n| R(\\boldsymbol{w}) - \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w}) | \\leq e_{\\mathrm{max}} c^2\n\nwhere e_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\max_{i,j} |\\sigma_{ij} - \\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}| = \\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} - \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\|_{\\infty}.\nFan, Liao and Shi (2015) use the concept of high confidence level upper bound (H-CLUB),\n\n\\mathbb{P} \\left[| R(\\boldsymbol{w}) - \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w}) | \\geq \\widehat{U}(\\tau) \\right] \\rightarrow 1 - \\tau, \\; \\; \\tau \\in (0,1)\n\n3.2. Estimation of a large volatility matrix\nExponential Smoothing\nDenote \\mathrm{var}_t(\\boldsymbol{R}_{t+1}) = \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_t the conditional covariance matrix of return on time t+1. The traditional way to estimate is using the return matrix from time t to time 1 and compute the sample covariance matrix as\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_t = \\frac{1}{t} \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \\boldsymbol{R}_{t-i} \\boldsymbol{R}^\\top_{t-i}\n\nIf we consider to localize the data, one naive way is to define a window h \\ll t and\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_t = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} \\boldsymbol{R}_{t-i} \\boldsymbol{R}^\\top_{t-i}\n\nA better way is using Exponential Smoothing method, with a smoothing parameter \\lambda,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_t = (1-\\lambda) \\frac{1}{t} \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \\lambda^i \\boldsymbol{R}_{t-i} \\boldsymbol{R}^\\top_{t-i}\n\nand the estimated volatility matrix can be computed recursively as\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_t = \\lambda \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{t-1} + (1 - \\lambda) \\boldsymbol{R}_{t} \\boldsymbol{R}^\\top_{t}\n\nThresholding regularization\nWhen the portfolio size is large, to deal with the ill-conditioned problem in estimation of volatility matrix, we can use a thresholding method. Given our estimated matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} and a thresholding parameter \\lambda,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\left(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} I\\left(|\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}| \\geq \\lambda\\right)\\right)_{(ij)}\n\nor using a adaptive thresholding estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\left(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} I\\left(|\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} / \\mathrm{SE}(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij})| \\geq \\lambda\\right)\\right)_{(ij)}\n\nwhere \\mathrm{SE}(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}) is the estimated standard error of \\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}.\nProjection onto positive definite matrix space\nTo make our estimated covariance matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda a valid covariance matrix after thresholding, we can use\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^\\top \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\cdots, \\lambda_p) \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}, \\; \\; \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda^+ = \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^\\top \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1^+, \\cdots, \\lambda_p^+) \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\n\nor we can solve a optimization problem, for any symmetric matrix \\boldsymbol{A},\n\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{R}} \\| \\boldsymbol{A} - \\boldsymbol{R} \\|_F^2, \\; \\; \\mathrm{s.t.} \\; \\boldsymbol{R} \\succeq 0, \\mathrm{diag}(\\boldsymbol{R}) = \\boldsymbol{I}_p\n\nHere \\boldsymbol{A} is set to\n\n\\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{-1/2} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda \\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{-1/2}\n\nand for the solution to the optimization problem \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_\\lambda, the corrected covariance matrix is\n\n\\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{1/2} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_\\lambda \\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{1/2}\n\nRegularization by penalized likelihood\nPenalized likelihood is useful to explore the sparsity. Denote l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) be the log-likelihood function, we assume \\boldsymbol{\\theta} is sparse and the penalized likelihood is\n\n\\arg \\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\left\\{-\\frac{2}{T}l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) + \\sum_{i=1}^p p_\\lambda(|\\theta_j|)\\right\\}\n\nwhere p_\\lambda is a penalty function. Usually we set p_\\lambda(|\\theta|) = \\lambda I(\\theta \\neq 0), the L_0 penalty, which results in the best subset selection. However, it is computationally expensive. The LASSO estimator, which uses L_1-penalty, is a convex relaxation but introduces biases due to the shrinkage of LASSO.\nFan and Li (2001) introduced a family of folded-concave penalty functions such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) whose derivative is\n\np_\\lambda^\\prime(t) = \\lambda \\left\\{I(t \\leq \\lambda) + \\frac{(a \\lambda - t)_+}{(a - 1)\\lambda} I(t > \\lambda) \\right\\}\n\nThe penalized likelihood with SCAD as penalty function can be solved by an iterated re-weighted LASSO using a local linear approximation (Zou and Li (2008)). For any estimate at k, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(k)}, the target is\n\nQ_{k+1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = -\\frac{2}{T}l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) + \\sum_{i=1}^p w_{k,j} |\\theta_j| + c\n\nwhere w_{k,j} = p_\\lambda^\\prime\\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right) and\n\nc = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left[p_\\lambda\\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}|\\right)- p_\\lambda^\\prime \\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right) |\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right]\n\nIt can be shown that this algorithm is a majorization-minimization algorithm where the target value is decreasing with respect to sequence \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(k)}.\nEstimate volatility matrix using factor model\nGiven factor model\n\n\\boldsymbol{R} = \\boldsymbol{a} + \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\nWe can run a regression to obtain \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} and the regression residuals \\hat{\\sigma}_1^2, \\cdots, \\hat{\\sigma}_p^2. And we can compute sample covariance matrix \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_f of \\boldsymbol{f}. If we assume noise terms are independent of each other, we have the strict factor model based estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^S = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_f \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^\\top + \\mathrm{diag}(\\hat{\\sigma}_1^2, \\cdots, \\hat{\\sigma}_p^2)\n\nThis estimator has a better rate for estimating \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} and the same rate for estimating \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} compared to the sample covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}.\nIf instead we do not assume the uncorrelatedness of noise term, but explore the sparsity instead. We will have the following approximate factor model estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_f \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^\\top + \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\lambda}^*\n\nwhere \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\lambda}^* is the estimated error covariance matrix applied thresholding on correlation matrix with parameter \\lambda.\nNotice that if \\lambda=1, then \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^S and if \\lambda=0, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A is the sample covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}.\nNow consider the approximate factor model with unobserved factors, we can use Principal Orthogonal complEment Thresholding (POET) by Fan, Liao and Mincheva (2013).\n\nObtain the sample covariance matrix \\boldsymbol{S} based on T returns.\nRun a singular value decomposition: \\boldsymbol{S}=\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{T}.\nCompute the residual covariance matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Q}}=\\sum_{j=K+1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{\\top}.\nRegularize Q to obtain \\widehat{Q}_{\\lambda}, e.g. correlation matrix thresholding.\nCompute the POET estimator as\n\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\lambda}^{P}=\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{T}+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Q}}_{\\lambda}\n\nPOET encompasses many methods, when \\lambda=0, it is sample covariance matrix; when \\lambda=1, it is strict factor model with unknown factors; when K=0, it is thresholded sample covariance matrix.\nHigh-dimensional PCA and factor analysis\nThe factor model\n\n\\boldsymbol{R}_t = \\boldsymbol{a} + (\\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{H}) (\\boldsymbol{H}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{f}_t) + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_t\n\nfor any non-singular matrix \\boldsymbol{H}. Therefore, we can assume \\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{f}_t) = \\boldsymbol{I}_K and columns of \\boldsymbol{B} are orthogonal. Therefore,\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{B}^\\top + \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_\\epsilon\n\nIf the factors are strong (pervasive), then we have asymptotically,\n\n\\sum_{j=K+1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{\\top} \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^K \\boldsymbol{b}_j \\boldsymbol{b}_j^\\top = \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{B}^\\top\n\nand\n\nf_{jt} \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\xi}^\\top_j \\boldsymbol{R}_t / \\lambda_j^{1/2}\n\nwhere \\{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_j\\}, \\{\\lambda_j\\} are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}_t.\n3.3. Portfolio allocation with gross-exposure constraints\nOur previous Markowitz’s mean-variance analysis is usually too sensitive on input vectors and their estimation errors and can result in extreme short positions. This problem is more severe for large portfolio.\nWe consider optimization with gross-exposure constraint:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\min_{\\boldsymbol{w}} R(\\boldsymbol{w}) =  \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w}  \\\\\n\\text{s,t.} \\; \\; &\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c, \\; \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\alpha\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow if we only consider the risk profile not the return. We can define actual and perceived risks:\n\nR(\\boldsymbol{w})=\\boldsymbol{w}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w}, \\quad \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w})=\\boldsymbol{w}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w}\n\nand oracle and empirical allocation vectors\n\n\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}=\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c} R(\\boldsymbol{w}), \\quad \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}=\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c} \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w})\n\nLet e_{\\max}=|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}-\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}. Then, we have,\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\left|R\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)-R\\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq 2 e_{\\max } c^{2}} \\\\ {\\left|R\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)-\\widehat{R}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq e_{\\max } c^{2}} \\\\ {\\left|R\\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}\\right)-\\widehat{R}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq e_{\\max } c^{2}}\\end{array}\n\nNow we show the convergence rate of e_{\\max}=|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}-\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}. If for a sufficiently large x,\n\n\\max _{i, j} P\\left\\{b_{T}\\left|\\sigma_{i j}-\\hat{\\sigma}_{i j}\\right|>x\\right\\}\nfor some positive constants a and C and rate b_{T}, then\n\n|\\Sigma-\\hat{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}=O_{P}\\left(\\frac{(\\log p)^{a}}{b_{T}}\\right)\n\nMoreover, suppose that \\left\\|R_{t}\\right\\|_{\\infty} is bounded and that the returns are weakly dependent in that its \\alpha mixing coefficient \\alpha(q) decays exponentially, namely \\alpha(q)= O\\left(\\exp \\left(-C q^{1 / b}\\right)\\right) for some b. If \\log p=o\\left(n^{1 /(2 b+1)}\\right), then we have the above convergence rate. (See Fan, Zhang and Yu (2012))\nTo better understand why the gross-exposure constraint helps on risk approximation, we make connections with covariance regularization. By the Lagrange multiplier method, our previous risk profile optimization is,\n\n\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w} / 2+\\lambda_{1}\\left(\\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1}-c\\right)+\\lambda_{2}\\left(1-\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\nLet g be the sub-gradient vector of the function \\|w\\|_{1}, whose i^{t h} element is -1, 1 or any values in [-1,1] depending on whether w_{i} is positive, negative or zero, respectively. Then, the first order condition is\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w}+\\lambda_{1} \\boldsymbol{g}-\\lambda_{2} \\mathbf{1}=0} \\\\ {\\lambda_{1}\\left(c-\\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1}\\right)=0, \\quad \\lambda_{1} \\geqslant 0}\\end{array}\n\nin addition to the constraints \\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1 and \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leqslant c. Let \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{w}} be the solution. We can show that it is also the solution to the unconstrained portfolio optimization problem\n\n\\min _{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1} \\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{c} \\boldsymbol{w}\n\nin which, with \\tilde{g} being the gradient evaluated at \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{w}},\n\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{c}=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}+\\lambda_{1}\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{g}} \\mathbf{1}^{\\top}+\\mathbf{1} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{g}}^{\\top}\\right)\n\nWe now show the link between regression and risk profile optimization. Set R_p = Y, X_j = R_j - R_p, we have\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{R})\n&= \\min_b \\mathbb{E} \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{R} - b\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= \\min_b \\mathbb{E} \\left(Y - w_1 X_1 - \\cdots - w_{p-1} X_{p-1} - b\\right)^2 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\nand the constraint on gross-exposure can be replaced by a similar L_1 norm.\n4. Chapter 8 Consumption based CAPM\n4.1. CCAPM\nRepresentative consumer consumes on a representative good with quantity C_{t} and price\np_{t} at time t.

Dynamic Programming\nThe term dynamic programming (DP) refers to a collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the environment as a Markov decision process (MDP).

Policy Evaluation\n\n3.2. Policy Improvement\nPolicy improvement theorem: Let \\pi and \\pi^{\\prime} be any pair of deterministic policies such that, for all s \\in \\mathcal{S},\n\nq_{\\pi}\\left(s, \\pi^{\\prime}(s)\\right) \\geq v_{\\pi}(s)\n\nthen for all s \\in \\mathcal{S},\n\nv_{\\pi^{\\prime}}(s) \\geq v_{\\pi}(s)\n\nTherefore, the new greedy policy \\pi^\\prime is given by\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi^{\\prime}(s)\n& \\doteq \\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&=\\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\;  S_{t}=s, A_{t}=a\\right] \\\\\n&=\\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\;  s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nIf the new policy \\pi^\\prime is just as good as the old one \\pi, then \\pi^\\prime is the optimal policy (satisfies Bellman optimal equation):\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{\\pi^{\\prime}}(s)\n&=\\max _{a} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\pi^{\\prime}}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\;  S_{t}=s, A_{t}=a\\right] \\\\\n&=\\max _{a} \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v_{\\pi^{\\prime}}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\n3.3. Policy Iteration\nCombine policy evaluation and policy improvement together, we have:\n\n3.4. Value Iteration\nOne drawback to policy iteration is that each of its iterations involves policy evaluation, which may itself be a protracted iterative computation requiring multiple sweeps through the state set.\nWe can consider using policy evaluation where it stops after just one sweep (one update of each state). This algorithm is called value iteration.\n\n4. Monte Carlo Methods\n4.1. Monte Carlo Prediction\n\nIf a model is not available, then it is particularly useful to estimate action values (the values of state–action pairs) rather than state values. With a model (in DP case), state values alone are sufficient to determine a policy; one simply looks ahead one step and chooses whichever action leads to the best combination of reward and next state.\n4.2. Monte Carlo Control\nThe algorithm is similar with DP case. However, we need to ensure all state-action pairs have a chance to be visited.\n\nWe can eliminate the exploring start assumption by using a \\epsilon-soft policy as follows:\n\nIt can be shown that\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{\\pi}\\left(s, \\pi^{\\prime}(s)\\right)\n&=\\sum_{a} \\pi^{\\prime}(a | s) q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+(1-\\varepsilon) \\max _{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&\\geq \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+(1-\\varepsilon) \\sum_{a} \\frac{\\pi(a | s)-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|}}{1-\\varepsilon} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+\\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&= v_{\\pi}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere the greater or equal is because the sum is a weighted average with nonnegative weights summing to 1, and as such it must be less than or equal to the largest number averaged.\nBy the policy improvement theorem \\pi^\\prime is better than \\pi and equality can hold only when both \\pi^\\prime and \\pi are optimal among the \\epsilon-soft policies, that is, when they are better than or equal to all other \\epsilon-soft policies.\n4.3. Off-policy Prediction and Control via Importance Sampling\nA more straightforward approach is to use two policies, one that is learned about and that becomes the optimal policy, and one that is more exploratory and is used to generate behavior. The policy being learned about is called the target policy, and the policy used to generate behavior is called the behavior policy. In this case we say that learning is from data off'' the target policy, and the overall process is termedoff''-policy learning.\nConsider the target policy \\pi and the behavior policy b, under \\pi, the state-action trajectory start from S_t has the probability,\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left\\{A_{t}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}, \\ldots, S_{T} \\; | \\; S_{t}, A_{t: T-1} \\sim \\pi\\right\\}} \\\\ {\\quad=\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right) p\\left(S_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) \\cdots p\\left(S_{T} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}\\right)} \\\\ {\\quad=\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}\\end{array}\n\nthe relative probability of the trajectory under the target and behavior policies is\n\n\\rho_{t: T-1} \\doteq \\frac{\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}{\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}=\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E} \\left[G_t \\; | \\; S_t\\right] = v_b(s), \\; \\; \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t} | S_{t}=s\\right]=v_{\\pi}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTo estimate v_\\pi(s), we simply scale the returns by the ratios and average the results:\n\nV(s) \\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} G_{t}}{|\\mathcal{T}(s)|}, \\; \\text{ or } \\; V(s) \\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} G_{t}}{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1}}\n\nwhere \\mathcal{T}(s) would only include time steps that were first visits to s within their episodes.\nThe incremental implementation of off-policy Monte Carlo evaluation is shown below, where C(S_t, A_t) is the cumulative weights.\n\nThe corresponding off-policy MC control algorithm is as follows.\n\nNotice that \\pi(S_t) is taken as a greedy policy and only when it coincides with the path of policy $b$, the update will continue within a episode. Therefore, \\pi(A_t | S_t) = 1.\n4.4. Optimize the Off-policy Importance Sampling\nDefine flat partial returns:\n\n\\bar{G}_{t: h} \\doteq R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+\\cdots+R_{h}, \\quad 0 \\leq t\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{aligned} G_{t}\n&\\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\gamma^{2} R_{t+3}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T} \\\\\n&=(1-\\gamma) R_{t+1} \\\\\n&\\quad +(1-\\gamma) \\gamma\\left(R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}\\right) \\\\\n&\\quad +(1-\\gamma) \\gamma^{2}\\left(R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+R_{t+3}\\right) \\\\\n&\\quad \\vdots \\\\\n&\\quad +(1-\\gamma) \\gamma^{T-t-2}\\left(R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+\\cdots+R_{T-1}\\right) \\\\\n&\\quad +\\gamma^{T-t-1}\\left(R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+\\cdots+R_{T}\\right) \\\\\n&= (1-\\gamma) \\sum_{h=t+1}^{T-1} \\gamma^{h-t-1} \\bar{G}_{t: h}+\\gamma^{T-t-1} \\bar{G}_{t: T} \\end{aligned}\n\nAnd the ordinary importance-sampling estimator and weighted importance-sampling estimator can be written as,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nV(s) &\\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)}\\left((1-\\gamma) \\sum_{h=t+1}^{T(t)-1} \\gamma^{h-t-1} \\rho_{t: h-1} \\bar{G}_{t: h}+\\gamma^{T(t)-t-1} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} \\bar{G}_{t: T(t)}\\right)}{|\\mathcal{T}(s)|} \\\\\nV(s) &\\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)}\\left((1-\\gamma) \\sum_{h=t+1}^{T(t)-1} \\gamma^{h-t-1} \\rho_{t: h-1} \\bar{G}_{t: h}+\\gamma^{T(t)-t-1} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} \\bar{G}_{t: T(t)}\\right)}{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)}\\left((1-\\gamma) \\sum_{h=t+1}^{T(t)-1} \\gamma^{h-t-1} \\rho_{t: h-1}+\\gamma^{T(t)-t-1} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe essence of the idea is to think of discounting as determining a probability of termination or, equivalently, a degree of partial termination. Therefore, the variance of importance sampling can be reduced.\nIn the off-policy estimators, each term of the sum in the numerator is itself a sum:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t}\n&=\\rho_{t: T-1}\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere\n\n\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}=\\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t+2} \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t+2} \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right)} \\cdots \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{T-1} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{T-1} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}\\right)} R_{t+1}\n\nWe can show that,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}\\right] &=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: t} R_{t+1}\\right] \\\\\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+k}\\right] &=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: t+k-1} R_{t+k}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThus,\n\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\tilde{G}_{t}\\right]\n\nwhere\n\n\\tilde{G}_{t} = \\rho_{t: t} R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t: t+1} R_{t+2}+\\gamma^{2} \\rho_{t: t+2} R_{t+3}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{T}\n\nand the ordinary/weighted average of returns can be defined accordingly. This method, known as Per-decision Importance Sampling, is useful to reduce the variance of importance sampling.\n5. Temporal-Difference Learning\n5.1.

Sarsa) is\n\nThe convergence properties of the Sarsa algorithm depend on the nature of the policy’s dependence on Q. For example, one could use \\epsilon-greedy policies. Sarsa converges with probability 1 to an optimal policy and action-value function as long as all state–action pairs are visited an infinite number of times and the policy converges in the limit to the greedy policy.\n5.2. Q-learning: Off-policy TD Control\nNotice that in TD(0) algorithm above, the step we take is based on current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t) and the bootstrap method we used to update Q(S_t,A_t) is also based on current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t). We can consider a off-policy control algorithm decouple the update from current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t).\n\nQ\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\max _{a} Q\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\n\nWe may also use expected value instead of maximum one:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\n&\\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[Q\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right]-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&\\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\n5.3. Double-Q Learning\nIn Q-learning the target policy is the greedy policy given the current action values, which is defined with a max, and in Sarsa the policy is often \\epsilon-greedy, which also involves a maximization operation. In these algorithms, a maximum over estimated values is used implicitly as an estimate of the maximum value, which can lead to a significant positive bias.\nWe can consider using two policy together and update one and only one of them each time.\n\n6. n-step Bootstrapping\n6.1. n-step On-policy learning\nThe complete return is\n\nG_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\gamma^{2} R_{t+3}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T}\n\nIn one-step updates the target is the first reward plus the discounted estimated value of the next state, which we call the one-step return:\n\nG_{t: t+1} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma V_{t}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)\n\nSimilarly, we can define n-step return as\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n}+\\gamma^{n} V_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t+n}\\right)\n\nThe n-step return has a better prediction error than one-step return under worst case:\n\n\\max _{s}\\left|\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t: t+n} \\; | \\; S_{t}=s\\right]-v_{\\pi}(s)\\right| \\leq \\gamma^{n} \\max _{s}\\left|V_{t+n-1}(s)-v_{\\pi}(s)\\right|\n\n\nand the n-step Sarsa can be derived similarly.\n\n6.2. n-step Off-policy Learning\nConsider the target policy \\pi and the behavior policy b. Define\n\n\\rho_{t: h} \\doteq \\prod_{k=t}^{\\min (h, T-1)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}\n\nTherefore, the off-policy n-step Sarsa is as follows.\n\n6.3. Per-decision Methods with Control Variates\nFor the n steps ending at horizon h, the n-step return can be written\n\nG_{t: h}=R_{t+1}+\\gamma G_{t+1: h}\n\nwith G_{h: h} \\doteq V_{h-1}\\left(S_{h}\\right). All of the resulting experience, including the first reward R_{t+1} and the next state S_{t+1} must be weighted by the importance sampling ratio for time t, \\rho_{t}=\\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}. If \\rho_t is zero, a simple weighting would result in the n-step return being zero, which could result in high variance when it was used as a target. Instead, consider\n\nG_{t: h} \\doteq \\rho_{t}\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma G_{t+1: h}\\right)+\\left(1-\\rho_{t}\\right) V_{h-1}\\left(S_{t}\\right)\n\nIf \\rho_t is zero, we just use current value to update (which causes no change), and since the expected value of \\rho_t is 1, this above update rule does not change the expected update.\nFor n-step expected Sarsa with the following rule:\n\nQ_{t+n}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\doteq Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha \\rho_{t+1: t+n}\\left[G_{t: t+n}-Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\nwe can write its corresponding control covariate method as\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nG_{t: h}\n&\\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma\\left(\\rho_{t+1} G_{t+1: h}+\\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-\\rho_{t+1} Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t+1}\\left(G_{t+1: h}-Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right)\\right)+\\gamma \\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right), \\quad t\nwhen \\rho_t = 0, we use the off-policy expectation \\bar{V}_{t}(s) \\doteq \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) Q_{t}(s, a) to make the update. And the expectation of \\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-\\rho_{t+1} Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right) is zero.\n6.4. Off-policy Learning Without Importance Sampling: The n-step Tree Backup Algorithm\nWe consider a off-policy without importance sampling. In n-step off-policy Sarsa, we estimate R_{t+j}, 1 \\leq j \\leq n using the reward from another policy b. We now consider estimate this return with expected value over all actions except the action we take.\nThe one-step return (target) is the same as that of Expected Sarsa,\n\nG_{t: t+1} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)\n\nfor t  and the two-step tree-backup return is\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nG_{t: t+2} &\\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma\n \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)\n\\\\ &\\quad \\quad \\quad \\; \\; +\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)\\left(R_{t+2}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+2}, a\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&= R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)+\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) G_{t+1: t+2} \\end{aligned}\n\nThe latter form suggests the general recursive definition of the tree-backup n-step return:\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)+\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) G_{t+1: t+n}\n\nThis can be illustrated from the backup diagram below.\n\nand the n-step tree-backup algorithm for control is:\n\n6.5.
