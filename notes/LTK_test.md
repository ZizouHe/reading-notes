## Summary

The main drawback of the KSD test ([Liu, et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03253.pdf)) is its high computational cost of O(n2). The Linear-Time Kernel test is one order of magnitude faster. Unfortunately, the decrease in the test power outweighs the computational gain. This paper seek a variant of the KSD statistic that can be computed in linear time, and whose test power is comparable to the KSD test.
