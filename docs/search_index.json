Neural ordinary differential equations. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 6572-6583).\n\nAuthor's code\n\n\n1. Summary\n\nMemory efficiency: Not storing any intermediate quantities of the forward pass allows us to train our models with constant memory cost as a function of depth, a major bottleneck of training deep models.\n\nAdaptive computation: Modern ODE solvers provide guarantees about the growth of approximation error, monitor the level of error, and adapt their evaluation strategy on the fly to achieve the requested level of accuracy. This allows the cost of evaluating a model to scale with problem complexity.\n\nParameter efficiency: When the hidden unit dynamics are parameterized as a continuous function of time, the parameters of nearby “layers” are automatically tied together which reduces the number of parameters required on a supervised learning task.\n\nScalable and invertible normalizing flows: the change of variables formula becomes easier to compute therefore it can avoid the single-unit bottleneck of normalizing flows, and can be trained directly by maximum likelihood.\n\n\n2. Feedforward structure\nThis paper introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of a series of discrete hidden layer, as\n\n\\mathbf { h } _ { t + 1 } = \\mathbf { h } _ { t } + f \\left( \\mathbf { h } _ { t } , \\theta _ { t } \\right)\n\nthe deep neural network can be parameterized by a continuous dynamics of hidden units using an ordinary differential equation scheme\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { h } ( t ) } { d t } = f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta )\n\nTherefore, the traditional network can be seen as this function f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ). And the feedforward step can be solved by a black-box differential equation solver.\n3. Backpropogate scheme\nThe backpropogation step is as follows. Consider the loss function,\n\nL \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 1 } \\right) \\right) = L \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 0 } \\right) + \\int _ { t _ { 0 } } ^ { t _ { 1 } } f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) d t \\right) = L \\left( \\operatorname { ODESolve } \\left( \\mathbf { h } \\left( t _ { 0 } \\right) , f , t _ { 0 } , t _ { 1 } , \\theta \\right) \\right)\n\nUsing adjoint sensitivity method,\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { a } ( t ) } { d t } = - \\mathbf { a } ( t ) ^ { \\top } \\frac { \\partial f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) } { \\partial \\mathbf { h } }, \\;\\; \\text{where} \\; \\mathbf { a } ( t ) = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf { h } ( t )}\n\nthis can be solved by a ODE solver once we know \\mathbf{h}(t) for any t_0 \\leq t \\leq t_1. This can be done by using a ODE solver of\n\n\\frac { d \\mathbf { h } ( t ) } { d t } = f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta )\n\nwith initial value \\mathbf{h}(t_1). With the knowledge of \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf { h } ( t )}, the gradient can be obtained by\n\n\\frac { d L } { d \\theta } = - \\int _ { t _ { 1 } } ^ { t _ { 0 } } \\mathbf { a } ( t ) ^ { \\top } \\frac { \\partial f ( \\mathbf { h } ( t ) , t , \\theta ) } { \\partial \\theta } d t\n\nstill can be done by a ODE solver. All integrals for solving \\mathbf{h}, \\mathbf{a} and \\partial L / \\partial \\theta  can be computed in a single call to an ODE solver, which concatenates the original state, the adjoint, and the other partial derivatives into a single vector. Therefore, each step in the ODE solver, once we get \\mathbf{h}(t), we can therefore obtain \\mathbf{a}(t) and afterwards, the gradient.\n"},"notes/RDN.html":{"url":"notes/RDN.html","title":"Relational Dependency Networks","keywords":"","body":" Relational Dependency Networks1. Summary2. Structure of the network2.1. RDN learning2.2. RDN inference Relational Dependency Networks\n\nNeville, J., & Jensen, D. (2007). Relational dependency networks. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 8(Mar), 653-692.\n\nRelational Machine Learning Library (RMLLib)\n\n\n1. Summary\nModel the data using the idea of relational database and consider the autocorrelation between instances. The learning algorithm is novel, learning the CPDs based on the query that can return local sub-graphs. The learning algorithm can also produce dependency which interprets the relation between attributes. The inference process utilize the Gibbs sampler. However, it does not have the property like Markov network that the product of CPD is indeed the joint distribution, which is a trade-off between theoretical guarantee and cyclical network that describe wider connection between attributes.\n2. Structure of the network\nInstead of consider independent instance case, RDN consider there are dependency (autocorrelation) among instances and therefore construct a whole large graph connected all instances (by connecting their attributes).\nThe relational data set is represented as a typed, attributed data graph G_D = (V_D,E_D). Consider the data graph in Figure 1(a). The nodes V_D represent objects in the data (e.g.,\nauthors, papers) and the edges E_D represent relations among the objects (e.g., author-of, cites). Each node v_i \\in V_D and edge e_j \\in E_D is associated with a type, T(v_i) = t_{v_i} and T(e_j) = t_{e_j} (e.g., paper, cited-by). Each item type t \\in T has a number of associated attributes \\boldsymbol{X}^t = (X^1_t , ..., X_m^t) (e.g., topic, year). Consequently, each object v_i and link e_j is associated with a set of attribute values\ndetermined by their type, \\boldsymbol{X}_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}} = (X_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}1} , \\ldots, X_{v_i}^{t_{v_i}m}) and \\boldsymbol{X}_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}} = (X_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}1} , \\ldots, X_{e_j}^{t_{e_j}m'}). A PRM represents a joint distribution over the values of the attributes in the data graph,\n\n\\boldsymbol{x}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}}^{\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}}}:v_{i} \\in V \\text{ s.t. }T(v_{i})=t_{v_{i}}\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\boldsymbol{e}_{j}}^{\\boldsymbol{t}_{\\boldsymbol{e}_{\\boldsymbol{j}}}}:e_{j} \\in E \\text{ s.t. } T(e_{j})=t_{e_{j}} \\right\\}\n\nFigure 1. Example (a) data graph and (b) model graph.\nThe network is represented by the product of conditional probability distributions (CPD) of one node given its parents. There are a few things need to be clarified:\n\nSince RDN is a cyclical graph, the product of CPD does not necessarily be the joint distribution, but under some conditions, it is quite close to the joint one.\n\nIn practice, the parents of one node is not given exhaustedly, moreover, we use query from relational database to return a local network for each node and condition on them.\n\nMany machine learning algorithms can reveal the dependency of the variables, i.e. from the local network queried, to select the nodes that are parents of one node.\n\n\n2.1. RDN learning\nThe pseudo-likelihood for data graph G_D is computed as a product over the item types t, the attributes of that type X_t, and the items of that type v,e:\n\nPL\\left(G_{D} ; \\theta\\right) = \\prod_{t \\in T} \\prod_{X_{i}^{t}\\in \\mathbf{X}^{t}}\\prod_{v:T(v)=t} p\\left(x_{v_i}^{t} | pa_{x_{v_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\\prod_{e:T(e)=t}p\\left(x_{e_i}^{t}|pa_{x_{e_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\n\nhere \\theta may not be an explicit set of parameters, but implicit structure like tree. Therefore, we can maximize CPD for every node to maximize pseudo-likelihood:\n\n\\prod_{v:T(v)=t} p\\left(x_{v_i}^{t} | pa_{x_{v_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right) \\; \\text{and} \\; \\prod_{e:T(e)=t}p\\left(x_{e_i}^{t}|pa_{x_{e_i}^{t}};\\theta\\right)\n\nusing some learners like Relational Bayesian Classifiers as well as Relational Probability Trees. After we maximize the pseudo-likelihood, we also learn the dependency among the nodes, like model graph in Figure 1(b).\n2.2.

Then, for each unknown node, we can randomly draw one sample from its CPD we have learned above.

Summary\nThis paper presents a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model with topics as latent variable. The parameter estimation and inference tasks can be made via a combination of variational method and EM algorithm.\n2. Structure\nWe define:\n\nA word is the basic unit of discrete data, defined to be an item from a vocabulary indexed by \\{1, .\\ldots , V \\}. We encode words with one-hot coding.\nA document is a sequence of N words denoted by \\mathbf{w} = (w_1,w_2, \\ldots ,w_N), where w_n is the nth word in the sequence.\nA corpus is a collection of M documents denoted by \\mathbf{D} = \\{\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2, \\ldots , \\mathbf{w}_M\\}.\n\nLDA assumes the following generative process for each document \\mathbf{w} in a corpus \\mathbf{D}:\n\nChoose N \\sim \\operatorname{Poisson}(\\xi).\nChoose \\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Dir}(\\alpha). The dimension of this Dirichlet distribution is assumed known and fixed.\nFor each of the N words w_n:\n (a) Choose a topic z_{n} \\sim \\text { Multinomial }(\\theta).\n (b) Choose a word w_n from p\\left(w_{n} | z_{n}, \\beta\\right), a multinomial probability conditioned on the topic z_n.\n\nBasically, we allocate the multinomial probability of k latent topics using hyper-parameter \\alpha and then sample each word from the sampled multinomial distribution.\n\nFigure 1: Graphical model representation of LDA. The boxes are \"plates\" representing replicates. The outer plate represents documents, while the inner plate represents the repeated choice of topics and words within a document.\nTherefore, we can obtain the marginal distribution of a document:\n\np(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)=\\int p(\\theta | \\alpha)\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\sum_{z_{n}} p\\left(z_{n} | \\theta\\right) p\\left(w_{n} | z_{n}, \\beta\\right)\\right) d \\theta\n\nThe probability of a corpus given parameter \\alpha, \\beta is\n\np(\\mathbf{D} | \\alpha, \\beta) =\\prod_{d=1}^{M} \\int p\\left(\\theta_{d} | \\alpha\\right)\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{N_{d}} \\sum_{z_{d n}} p\\left(z_{d n} | \\theta_{d}\\right) p\\left(w_{d n} | z_{d n}, \\beta\\right)\\right) d \\theta_{d}\n\n3. Learning and Inference\nThe key inferential problem that we need to solve in order to use LDA is that of computing the posterior distribution of the hidden variables given a document:\n\np(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{w}, \\alpha, \\beta)=\\frac{p(\\theta, \\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)}{p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta)}\n\nwhich is intractable because of the intractability of p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta). We consider using a variational inference method to approximate this posterior distribution:\n\nq(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\gamma, \\phi)=q(\\theta | \\gamma) \\prod_{n=1}^{N} q\\left(z_{n} | \\phi_{n}\\right)\n\nAs for the learning task, we wish to find parameters \\alpha and \\beta that maximize the (marginal) log likelihood of the data:\n\n\\ell(\\alpha, \\beta)=\\sum_{d=1}^{M} \\log p\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{d} | \\alpha, \\beta\\right)\n\nsince p(\\mathbf{w} | \\alpha, \\beta) is intractable, We can thus find approximate empirical Bayes estimates for the LDA model via an alternating variational EM procedure that maximizes a lower bound with respect to the variational parameters \\gamma and \\phi, and then, for fixed values of the variational parameters, maximizes the lower bound with respect to the model parameters \\alpha and \\beta:\n\n(E-step) For each document, find the optimizing values of the variational parameters \\left\\{\\gamma_{d}^{*}, \\phi_{d}^{*} :d \\in \\mathbf{D} \\right\\}. This minimization can be achieved via an iterative fixed-point method.\n\n\n\\left(\\gamma^{*}, \\phi^{*}\\right)=\\arg \\min _{(\\gamma, \\phi)} \\mathrm{D}(q(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\gamma, \\phi) \\| p(\\theta, \\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{w}, \\alpha, \\beta))\n\n\n(M-step) Maximize the resulting lower bound on the log likelihood with respect to the model parameters \\alpha and \\beta. This corresponds to finding maximum likelihood estimates with expected sufficient statistics for each document under the approximate posterior which is computed in the E-step.\n\n"},"notes/KSD_test.html":{"url":"notes/KSD_test.html","title":"KSD for Goodness-of-fit Tests","keywords":"","body":" A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests1.

Furthermore, if a class of distributions has such a compression scheme, then so do the classes of products and mixtures of those distributions.\n2. Definition\nDefinition.

A distribution decoder for \\mathcal{F} is a deterministic function \\mathcal{J} : \\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty} Z^{n} \\times \\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\{0,1\\}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}, which takes a finite sequence of elements of Z and a finite sequence of bits, and outputs a member of \\mathcal{F}\nDefinition. Let \\tau, t, m :(0,1) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{ \\geq 0} be functions, and let r \\geq 0. We say \\mathcal{F} admits (\\tau, t, m) r-robust compression if there exists a decoder \\mathcal{J} for \\mathcal{F} such that for any distribution g \\in \\mathcal{F}, and for any distribution q on Z with \\|g-q\\|_{1} \\leq r, the following holds:\nFor any \\varepsilon \\in(0,1), if a sample S is drawn from q^{m(\\varepsilon) \\log 1 / \\delta}, then with probability at least 1 - \\delta, there exists a sequence L of at most \\tau(\\varepsilon) elements of S, and a sequence B of at most t(\\varepsilon) bits, such that \\|\\mathcal{J}(L, B)-g\\|_{1} \\leq \\varepsilon\nNote that here q can be seen as a corrupted version of real distribution g, and the data is drawn from this corrupted one. And here L and B are sequences therefore can contain repeated elements. Essentially, the definition asserts that with probability 2/3, there is a (short) sequence of elements S and some (small number of) additional bits, from which g can be approximately reconstructed.\nTheorem.

Summary\nIn this paper, a complete framework to direct the MCMC samplers has been presented. It shows that this framework is sufficient and necessary for all MCMC samplers. As many recent work try to use stochastic gradient version MCMC samplers as a consideration of computation, this method mainly introduce a systematical way to guide SGMCMC. Based on this framework, a new MCMC sampler called stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC) has also been introduced\n2. A Stochastic Gradient MCMC Framework\nIn general, we can write all continuous Markov processes as the following form stochastic differential equation:\n\r\n\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{z}= f(\\mathbf{z}) \\mathrm{d} t+ \\sqrt{2 \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z})} \\mathrm{d} \\mathrm{W}(t)\r\n\nwhere f(\\mathbf{z}) denotes the deterministic drift and \\mathrm{W}(t) is a d-dimensional Wiener Process, and D(\\mathbf{z}) is a positive semi-definite diffusion matrix. Notice that only some choices of f(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) yields a stationary distribution with the form p^s(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp^{-H(\\mathbf{z})}. Here H(\\mathbf{z}) is related to Hamiltonian MC as well as other MCMC algorithms.\nThis paper proposes to write f(\\mathbf{z}) into the following form:\n\r\n\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{z})=-[\\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z})+\\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z})] \\nabla H(\\mathbf{z})+\\Gamma(\\mathbf{z}), \\quad \\mathrm{P}_{i}(\\mathbf{z})=\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{z}_{j}}\\left(\\mathrm{D}_{i j}(\\mathbf{z})+\\mathrm{Q}_{i j}(\\mathbf{z})\\right)\r\n\nHere \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) is a skew-symmetric curl matrix representing the deterministic traversing effects seen in HMC procedures. In contrast, the diffusion matrix \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) determines the strength of the Wiener-process-driven diffusion. Matrices \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) can be adjusted to attain faster convergence to the posterior distribution.\nIt is stated that if we specifically write f(\\mathbf{z}) into the above form, then the stationary distribution of SDE has the form of p^s(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp^{-H(\\mathbf{z})}. Moreover, if the stationary distribution of SDE uniquely exists, then there exists skew-symmetric curl matrix \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) such that we can write f(\\mathbf{z}) in the SDE to our specified form, and therefore the stationary distribution has our desired form.\n3. Practical Algorithms and Discussions\n3.1. \\varepsilon-discretization Update\nIn practice, we choose a step size of \\varepsilon and update using the following discretized form of SDE:\n\r\n\\mathbf{z}_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\epsilon_{t}\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\mathrm{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\nabla H\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\Gamma\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right]+\\mathcal{N}\\left(0,2 \\epsilon_{t} \\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right)\r\n\nIn the above step, instead of evaluating the gradient using full data, we can use part of the data to do a stochastic-gradient-descent-style update in order to achieve computation efficiency. Although this SG step is unbiased, it does introduce extra noise into the training procedure. It can be shown that this noise is asymptotically normal, and we can partly subtract this noise by\n\r\n\\mathbf{z}_{t+1} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\epsilon_{t}\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\mathrm{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\nabla \\widetilde{H}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)+\\Gamma\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)\\right]+\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\epsilon_{t}\\left(2 \\mathrm{D}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right)-\\epsilon_{t} \\hat{\\mathrm{B}}_{t}\\right)\\right)\r\n\nwhere \\widetilde{H}\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}\\right) is the down-sampled version of gradient and \\hat{\\mathrm{B}}_{t} is our estimated noise term. It is also true that this SGD-correction training procedure also yields the correct invariant distribution.\n3.2. Construct Samplers with Proposed Framework\nThe authors shows that all previous MCMC methods, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC), Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) as well as Stochastic Gradient Riemannian Langevin Dynamics (SGRLD) are all adapted to this framework.\nSince the matrices \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathbf{z}) and \\mathrm{D}(\\mathbf{z}) can be adjusted, a new sampler called Stochastic Gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC) has been presented which introduces Fisher information metric as a way to utilize the geometry information of our targeted distribution.

Sharp minima can generalize for deep nets. In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70 (pp. 1019-1028).\n\n1. Summary\nThis paper criticizes some previous definitions of sharpness (for the local minima of loss function) to be unsuitable under the settings of deep neural networks. However, this phenomenon is because the loss function of deep neural networks typically cannot guarantee the positive definite property of Hessian matrix around local minima and those definitions of sharpness usually require some assumptions include positive definite Hessian and smoothness to guarantee the generalization property.\n2. Proof using Re-parameterization Tricks\nDeep neural network has the issue of over-parameterization. Consider a one-hidden layer network, \\boldsymbol{y} = \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x} \\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}) \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2} with ReLU as activation function \\sigma(\\cdot), a transformation T_\\alpha(\\cdot) on the parameter space (\\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2}) is\n\nT_\\alpha(\\cdot): (\\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2}) \\rightarrow (\\alpha \\boldsymbol{\\theta_1}, \\alpha^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\theta_2})\n\nThis transformation can be extended to deeper networks and convolution layer can also be included. For the sharpness defined below,\nDefinition. Given \\varepsilon > 0, a minimum \\theta, and a loss L, we define C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon) as the largest (using inclusion as the partial order over the subsets of \\theta) connected set containing \\theta such that \\forall \\theta^\\prime \\in C(L,\\theta,\\varepsilon), L(\\theta′) . The \\varepsilon-flatness will be defined as the volume of C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon). We will call this measure the volume \\varepsilon-flatness.\nDefinition. Let \\mathcal{B}_2(\\varepsilon,\\theta) be an Euclidean ball centered on a minimum \\theta with radius \\varepsilon. Then, for a non-negative valued loss function L, the \\varepsilon-sharpness will be defined as proportional to\n\n\\frac{\\max _{\\theta^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{2}(\\epsilon, \\theta)}\\left(L\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}\\right)-L(\\theta)\\right)}{1+L(\\theta)} \\approx \\frac{\\left|\\left\\|\\left(\\nabla^{2} L\\right)(\\theta)\\right\\|\\right|_{2} \\epsilon^{2}}{2(1+L(\\theta))}\n\nwe can use re-parameterization trick to get the result that for neural networks defined above, C(L, \\theta, \\varepsilon) has infinite volume and \\varepsilon-sharpness can be arbitrarily large or small without changing the generalization power.\nMoreover, for any Hessian-based or Jacobian-based definition, it is not valid to be considered in deep neural networks settings.\n"},"notes/Sharpe_Minima_Exp.html":{"url":"notes/Sharpe_Minima_Exp.html","title":"Large Batch Training and Sharpe Minima","keywords":"","body":" On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima1.

Summary\nThis paper discusses the phenomenon the generalization gap (test error drop) for the large-batch SGD. It states that large-batch SGD training is more likely to converge to the sharp minima while the small-batch SGD converges to the flat minima, which is due to the inherent noise in the training.\n2. Generalization Gap for Large-batch\nEmpirically, large-batch SGD experience a drop in test error and by experiment, we can check that this is not caused by over-fitting. Another explanation could be sharpness, as in the lens of the minimum description length (MDL) theory, which states that statistical models that require fewer bits to describe generalize better. Since flat minima can be specified with lower precision than to sharp minima, they tend to have better generalization performance. Alternative theory of sharpness and generalization are presented through the Bayesian view of learning and the lens of free Gibbs energy.\n3. Sharpness and Explanation\nAs defined in the paper, let\n\n\\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p} :-\\epsilon\\left(\\left|\\left(A^{+} x\\right)_{i}\\right|+1\\right) \\leq z_{i} \\leq \\epsilon\\left(\\left|\\left(A^{+} x\\right)_{i}\\right|+1\\right) \\quad \\forall i \\in\\{1,2, \\cdots, p\\}\\right\\}\n\nwhere A^+ denotes the pseudo-inverse of A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p} and \\epsilon > 0 controls the size of the box. Therefore, we define the \\left(\\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}, A\\right)-sharpness of f at x as:\n\n\\phi_{x, f}(\\epsilon, A) :=\\frac{\\left(\\max _{y \\in \\mathcal{C}_{\\epsilon}} f(x+A y)\\right)-f(x)}{1+f(x)} \\times 100\n\nUsing the defined sharpness, the local minima found by large-batch method has larger sharpness than that found by small-batch empirically.\nAlthough they are all unbiased gradient estimators, large-batch has small variance which makes it more likely to be stuck in a sharp minima. However, as small-batch introduces much more noise, it has the property of exploration and therefore can avoid the trap of sharp minima. Large-batch methods lack this explorative properties of small-batch methods and tend to zoom-in on the minima closest to the initial point.\nHowever, this definition of sharpness is not very rigorous in a deep neural network setting, as will be shown in Sharp minima can generalize for deep nets.\n"},"notes/RMLHMC.html":{"url":"notes/RMLHMC.html","title":"Riemann Manifold Langevin and HMC","keywords":"","body":" Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods1.

Summary\nThis paper extend two MCMC algorithms: Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo from Euclidean space to Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. This is done by utilizing the geometry information associated with probability density function.\n2. Enlightenment from Metropolis Adjusted Langevin and HMC\n2.1. Metropolis Adjusted Langevin\nBased on a Langevin diffusion, the SDE with stationary distribution p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is\n\r\n\\mathrm{d} \\theta(t)=\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)\\} \\mathrm{d} t / 2+\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{b}(t)\r\n\nwhere \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\equiv \\log \\{p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\} and \\mathbf{b} denotes a D-dimensional Brownian motion. A first-order Euler discretization of the SDE gives the proposal mechanism\n\r\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}+\\varepsilon^{2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}\\right) / 2+\\varepsilon \\mathbf{z}^{n}\r\n\nwhere \\mathbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{z} | \\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}) and \\epsilon is the integration step size. Notice that the error this discretization introduces can be corrected by employing a Metropolis acceptance probability after each integration step.\nAlthough the drift term in the proposal mechanism for the Metropolis Adjusted Langevin defines the direction for the proposal based on the gradient information, it is clear that the isotropic diffusion will be inefficient for strongly correlated variables \\boldsymbol{\\theta} with widely differing variances forcing the step size to accommodate the variate with smallest variance. This issue can be circumvented by employing a preconditioning matrix M such that\n\r\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}+\\varepsilon^{2} \\mathbf{M} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{n}\\right) / 2+\\varepsilon \\sqrt{\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{z}}^{n}\r\n\n2.2. HMC\nWith a auxiliary variable \\boldsymbol{p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{0}, M), we can define the negative joint log-probability as\n\r\nH(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\mathbf{p})=-\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})+\\frac{1}{2} \\log \\left\\{(2 \\pi)^{D}|\\mathbf{M}|\\right\\}+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{p}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{p}\r\n\nwhere the kinetic energy term \\mathbf{p}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{p} / 2 where the covariance matrix \\mathbf{M} denotes a mass matrix.\nIt can be shown that the discrete version of HMC (leapfrog method) is equivalent to a Metropolis Adjusted Langevin with precondition matrix \\mathbf{M}.\n3. Geometry Information in Probability\nA distance metric based on a first order expression for the symmetric Kullback-Liebler divergence between two densities p and q is defined as\n\r\nD_{\\mathcal{S}}(p \\| q)=D(p \\| q)+D(q \\| p)\r\n\nTherefore, up to a small term, we have\n\r\nD_{\\mathcal{S}}(p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}+\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\| p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})) = \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\top} E_{\\mathbf{y} | \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left\\{\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\log p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\log p(\\mathbf{y} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})^{\\top}\\right\\} \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\top} \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\r\n\nwhere \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is the Fisher Information matrix.\nThe parameter space of a statistical model is a Riemannian manifold. Therefore\nthe natural geometric structure of the density model p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is defined by the Riemannian manifold and associated metric tensor. Given this geometric structure of the parameter space of statistical models the appropriate adoption of the position specific metric, \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), within an MCMC scheme should yield more effective transitions in the overall algorithm.\n4. Manifold Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm\nGiven the geometric structure for probability models a Langevin diffusion with invariant measure p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) can be defined directly upon the Riemannian manifold with metric tensor \\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}):\n\r\nd \\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)=\\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)) d t+d \\tilde{\\mathbf{b}}(t)\r\n\nwhere\n\r\n\\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))=\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t)) \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))\r\n\nand\n\r\nd \\tilde{\\mathbf{b}}_{i}(t)=|\\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))|^{-1 / 2} \\sum_{j=1}^{D} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{j}}\\left(\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))_{i j}|\\mathbf{G}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))|^{1 / 2}\\right) d t+\\left(\\sqrt{\\mathbf{G}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t))} d \\mathbf{b}(t)\\right)_{i}\r\n\n5.

Summary\nThis paper empirically analyzes the loss function properties of five popular SGD optimization methods: SGD, SGD with Momentum, RMSprop, Adadelta and Adam.

The shapes of the loss functions near the final solution differ across algorithms, and we trace this back to different algorithms selecting weight vectors with a consistent norm. Switching from one optimization algorithm to another late in training results in a final point characteristic of the second optimization algorithm. \nBatch normalization is key to obtaining this consistency in the projected loss surface. Without it, we see much more variability across re-runs from different initializations. \n\n"},"notes/Good_Semi_Bad_GAN.html":{"url":"notes/Good_Semi_Bad_GAN.html","title":"Good Semi-supervised Learning that Requires a Bad GAN","keywords":"","body":" Good Semi-supervised Learning that Requires a Bad GAN1.

W., & Salakhutdinov, R. R. (2017). Good semi-supervised learning that requires a bad gan. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 6510-6520).\n\n1. Summary\nThis paper shows that given a discriminator objective, good semi-supervised learning indeed requires a bad generator, and propose the definition of a preferred generator.\n2. Problem Setups\nGiven a labeled set L = \\{(x, y)\\}, let \\{1, 2, \\cdots , K\\} be the label space for classification. Let D and G denote the discriminator and generator, and P_D and p_G denote the corresponding distributions. Consider the discriminator objective function of GAN-based semi-supervised learning, (this is the standard objective function for GAN-based semi-supervised learning)\n\n\\max _{D} \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{L}} \\log P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K)+\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p} \\log P_{D}(y \\leq K | x)+\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{G}} \\log P_{D}(K+1 | x)\n\nwhere P is the true data distribution. The probability distribution P_D is over K + 1 classes where the first K classes are true classes and the (K + 1)-th class is the fake class. The objective function consists of three terms. The first term is to maximize the log conditional probability for labeled data, which is the standard cost as in supervised learning setting. The second term is to maximize the log probability of the first K classes for unlabeled data. The third term is to maximize the log probability of the (K + 1)-th class for generated data.\nLet f(x) be a nonlinear vector-valued function, and w_k be the weight vector for class k. The discriminator D can be defined as\n\nP_{D}(k | x)=\\frac{\\exp \\left(w_{k}^{\\top} f(x)\\right)}{\\sum_{k^{\\prime}=1}^{K+1} \\exp \\left(w_{k^{\\prime}}^{\\top} f(x)\\right)}\n\nSince this is a form of over-parameterization, w_{K+1} is fixed as a zero vector.\n3. Perfect generator\nTheorem. If the generator distribution p_G matches the truen data distribution p, i.e. p_G = p, and discriminator D has infinite capacity, then for any optimal solution D = (w,f) of the following supervised objective,\n\n\\max _{D} \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{L}} \\log P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K)\n\nthere exists D^* = (w^*, f^*) such that D^* maximizes the semi-supervised cost function and that for all x, P_{D}(y | x, y \\leq K) = P_{D^*}(y | x, y \\leq K).\nThis theorem states that given a perfect generator, there is no benefit for introducing the unlabeled data, i.e. the discriminator cannot improved by unsupervised part.\n4. Complement generator\nThe function f maps data points in the input space to the feature space. Let p_k(f) be the density of the data points of class k in the feature space. Given a threshold \\epsilon_k, let F_k be a subset of the data support where p_{k}(f)>\\epsilon_{k}, i.e., F_{k}=\\left\\{f : p_{k}(f)>\\epsilon_{k}\\right\\}. We assume that given \\left\\{\\epsilon_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{K}, the F_k’s are disjoint with a margin.\nSuppose \\cup_{k=1}^{K} F_{k} is bounded by a convex set \\mathcal{B}. If the support F_G of a generator G in the feature space is a relative complement set in \\mathcal{B}, i.e., F_{G}=\\mathcal{B}-\\cup_{k=1}^{K} F_{k}, we call G a complement generator.\nThen the paper states that when G is a complement generator, under mild assumptions, a near- optimal D learns correct decision boundaries in each high-density subset F_k (defined by \\epsilon_k) of the data support in the feature space. Intuitively, the generator generates complement samples so the logits of the true classes are forced to be low in the complement. As a result, the discriminator obtains class boundaries in low-density areas.\n5. Pros and cons of feature matching\nBy matching the first-order moment by SGD, feature matching is performing some kind of distribution matching, though in a rather weak manner. Loosely speaking, feature matching has the effect of generating samples close to the manifold. But due to its weak power in distribution matching, feature matching will inevitably generate samples outside of the manifold, especially when the data complexity increases. Consequently, the generator density p_G is usually lower than the true data density p within the manifold and higher outside. Hence, an optimal discriminator P_{D^*} (K+1 | x)=p(x) /\\left(p(x)+p_{G}(x)\\right) could still distinguish between true and generated samples in many cases.\n"},"notes/Faster_Frank_Wolfe.html":{"url":"notes/Faster_Frank_Wolfe.html","title":"Faster Rates for Frank-Wolfe over Strongly-Convex Sets","keywords":"","body":" Faster Rates for the Frank-Wolfe Method over Strongly-Convex Sets1.

Summary\nThis paper consider the special case of optimization over strongly convex sets, for which the authors prove a convergence rate of \\frac{1}{t^2} for Frank-Wolfe method. They also show that various balls induced by l_p norms, Schatten norms and group norms are strongly convex on one hand and on the other hand, linear optimization over these sets is straightforward and admits a closed-form solution.\n2. Frank-Wolfe method\nThe Frank-Wolfe method, originally introduced by Frank and Wolfe in the 1950's, is a first order method for the minimization of a smooth convex function over a convex set. Compared to projection method, which is also a first order method on convex set, Frank-Wolfe method is projection free. Its main advantage in large-scale problems is that this projection-free characteristic makes computation efficient. First order and projection-free features enabled the derivation of algorithms that are practical on one hand and come with provable convergence rates on the other.\nFigure 1. Frank-Wolfe Algorithm\nAbove is the general Frank-Wolfe method, where \\mathcal{K} \\subset E is the convex feasible set and \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathcal{K}}(c), c \\in E returns a point x=\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathcal{K}}(c) \\in \\mathcal{K} such that x \\in \\arg \\min _{y \\in \\mathcal{K}} \\langle y, c \\rangle. Step 4 does the exact line search for Frank-Wolfe method. In fact, the RHS is a upper bound for the exact line search object \\min_{\\eta_t} f(x_{t}+\\eta_{t}\\left(p_{t}-x_{t}\\right)) and is a easy-to-solve quadratic form.\n3. Previous result\nTheorem.

With Risk-free asset\nOptimize allocation factor using Markowitz's mean-variance optimization, which is equivalent to optimize the expected utility under exponential utility. Notice that the risk-free asset here can be used to eliminate the constraint of weights sum to one.\nFor any optimal solutions, they have the same Sharpe ratio, therefore the efficient frontier is a line with slope=optimal Sharpe ratio and intercept the risk-free rate.\nFigure 1. Efficient Frontier with risk-free asset\nIt can be shown that the market portfolio (with market value-weighted allocation vector) is on the efficient frontier and by two fund separation theorem, any efficient portfolio can be decomposed into the market portfolio and the risk-free one.\nCAPM: For the excess return Y of any portfolio, denote Y^m as the excess return of market portfolio, we have\n\nY = \\beta Y^m + \\epsilon, \\; \\; \\beta = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(Y, Y^m)}{\\mathrm{Var}(Y^m)}\n\nand \\epsilon is the external noise.\nThe CAPM model can be validated using\n\nEconometrics: regression and hypothesis testing\nMaximum likelihood estimation with Wald test or likelihood ratio test.\n\n1.2. Without Risk-free asset\nWe need to solve a constraint version of Markowitz's mean-variance optimization problem. It is also not hard using Lagrangian. This time, the efficient frontier is a parabola.\nFigure 2. Efficient Frontier without risk-free asset\nFor any portfolio on the frontier, you can find another one on the frontier that has zero beta with the previous one. The CAPM model is similarly formulated using one portfolio (as market portfolio) and its excess return is compared using its zero-beta counterparts (as risk-free one).\n2.

PCA and factor analysis\nFor the multi-factor pricing model, if we assume the residual covariance matrix is identity matrix, then it can be shown that the solution of MLE is the same as PCA results. \\boldsymbol{B} and the first K principal component of sample covariance matrix of return \\boldsymbol{R} span the same subspace.\nWhen the portfolio size is large, the PCA and factor analysis are approximately the same.

Given our estimated matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} and a thresholding parameter \\lambda,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\left(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} I\\left(|\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}| \\geq \\lambda\\right)\\right)_{(ij)}\n\nor using a adaptive thresholding estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\left(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} I\\left(|\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij} / \\mathrm{SE}(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij})| \\geq \\lambda\\right)\\right)_{(ij)}\n\nwhere \\mathrm{SE}(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}) is the estimated standard error of \\widehat{\\sigma}_{ij}.\nProjection onto positive definite matrix space\nTo make our estimated covariance matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda a valid covariance matrix after thresholding, we can use\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda = \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^\\top \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\cdots, \\lambda_p) \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}, \\; \\; \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda^+ = \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^\\top \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1^+, \\cdots, \\lambda_p^+) \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\n\nor we can solve a optimization problem, for any symmetric matrix \\boldsymbol{A},\n\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{R}} \\| \\boldsymbol{A} - \\boldsymbol{R} \\|_F^2, \\; \\; \\mathrm{s.t.} \\; \\boldsymbol{R} \\succeq 0, \\mathrm{diag}(\\boldsymbol{R}) = \\boldsymbol{I}_p\n\nHere \\boldsymbol{A} is set to\n\n\\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{-1/2} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda \\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{-1/2}\n\nand for the solution to the optimization problem \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_\\lambda, the corrected covariance matrix is\n\n\\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{1/2} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_\\lambda \\mathrm{diag}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_\\lambda)^{1/2}\n\nRegularization by penalized likelihood\nPenalized likelihood is useful to explore the sparsity. Denote l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) be the log-likelihood function, we assume \\boldsymbol{\\theta} is sparse and the penalized likelihood is\n\n\\arg \\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\left\\{-\\frac{2}{T}l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) + \\sum_{i=1}^p p_\\lambda(|\\theta_j|)\\right\\}\n\nwhere p_\\lambda is a penalty function. Usually we set p_\\lambda(|\\theta|) = \\lambda I(\\theta \\neq 0), the L_0 penalty, which results in the best subset selection. However, it is computationally expensive. The LASSO estimator, which uses L_1-penalty, is a convex relaxation but introduces biases due to the shrinkage of LASSO.\nFan and Li (2001) introduced a family of folded-concave penalty functions such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) whose derivative is\n\np_\\lambda^\\prime(t) = \\lambda \\left\\{I(t \\leq \\lambda) + \\frac{(a \\lambda - t)_+}{(a - 1)\\lambda} I(t > \\lambda) \\right\\}\n\nThe penalized likelihood with SCAD as penalty function can be solved by an iterated re-weighted LASSO using a local linear approximation (Zou and Li (2008)). For any estimate at k, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(k)}, the target is\n\nQ_{k+1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = -\\frac{2}{T}l_T(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) + \\sum_{i=1}^p w_{k,j} |\\theta_j| + c\n\nwhere w_{k,j} = p_\\lambda^\\prime\\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right) and\n\nc = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left[p_\\lambda\\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}|\\right)- p_\\lambda^\\prime \\left(|\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right) |\\widehat{\\theta}_j^{(k)}| \\right]\n\nIt can be shown that this algorithm is a majorization-minimization algorithm where the target value is decreasing with respect to sequence \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(k)}.\nEstimate volatility matrix using factor model\nGiven factor model\n\n\\boldsymbol{R} = \\boldsymbol{a} + \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\nWe can run a regression to obtain \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} and the regression residuals \\hat{\\sigma}_1^2, \\cdots, \\hat{\\sigma}_p^2. And we can compute sample covariance matrix \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_f of \\boldsymbol{f}. If we assume noise terms are independent of each other, we have the strict factor model based estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^S = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_f \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^\\top + \\mathrm{diag}(\\hat{\\sigma}_1^2, \\cdots, \\hat{\\sigma}_p^2)\n\nThis estimator has a better rate for estimating \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} and the same rate for estimating \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} compared to the sample covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}.\nIf instead we do not assume the uncorrelatedness of noise term, but explore the sparsity instead. We will have the following approximate factor model estimator,\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_f \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^\\top + \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\lambda}^*\n\nwhere \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\lambda}^* is the estimated error covariance matrix applied thresholding on correlation matrix with parameter \\lambda.\nNotice that if \\lambda=1, then \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^S and if \\lambda=0, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^A is the sample covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}.\nNow consider the approximate factor model with unobserved factors, we can use Principal Orthogonal complEment Thresholding (POET) by Fan, Liao and Mincheva (2013).\n\nObtain the sample covariance matrix \\boldsymbol{S} based on T returns.\nRun a singular value decomposition: \\boldsymbol{S}=\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{T}.\nCompute the residual covariance matrix \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Q}}=\\sum_{j=K+1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{\\top}.\nRegularize Q to obtain \\widehat{Q}_{\\lambda}, e.g. correlation matrix thresholding.\nCompute the POET estimator as\n\n\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\lambda}^{P}=\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{T}+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Q}}_{\\lambda}\n\nPOET encompasses many methods, when \\lambda=0, it is sample covariance matrix; when \\lambda=1, it is strict factor model with unknown factors; when K=0, it is thresholded sample covariance matrix.\nHigh-dimensional PCA and factor analysis\nThe factor model\n\n\\boldsymbol{R}_t = \\boldsymbol{a} + (\\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{H}) (\\boldsymbol{H}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{f}_t) + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_t\n\nfor any non-singular matrix \\boldsymbol{H}. Therefore, we can assume \\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{f}_t) = \\boldsymbol{I}_K and columns of \\boldsymbol{B} are orthogonal. Therefore,\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{B}^\\top + \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_\\epsilon\n\nIf the factors are strong (pervasive), then we have asymptotically,\n\n\\sum_{j=K+1}^{p} \\widehat{\\lambda}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{j}^{\\top} \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^K \\boldsymbol{b}_j \\boldsymbol{b}_j^\\top = \\boldsymbol{B} \\boldsymbol{B}^\\top\n\nand\n\nf_{jt} \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\xi}^\\top_j \\boldsymbol{R}_t / \\lambda_j^{1/2}\n\nwhere \\{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_j\\}, \\{\\lambda_j\\} are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of covariance matrix of \\boldsymbol{R}_t.\n3.3. Portfolio allocation with gross-exposure constraints\nOur previous Markowitz’s mean-variance analysis is usually too sensitive on input vectors and their estimation errors and can result in extreme short positions. This problem is more severe for large portfolio.\nWe consider optimization with gross-exposure constraint:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\min_{\\boldsymbol{w}} R(\\boldsymbol{w}) =  \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w}  \\\\\n\\text{s,t.} \\; \\; &\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c, \\; \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\alpha\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow if we only consider the risk profile not the return. We can define actual and perceived risks:\n\nR(\\boldsymbol{w})=\\boldsymbol{w}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w}, \\quad \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w})=\\boldsymbol{w}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w}\n\nand oracle and empirical allocation vectors\n\n\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}=\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c} R(\\boldsymbol{w}), \\quad \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}=\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leq c} \\widehat{R}(\\boldsymbol{w})\n\nLet e_{\\max}=|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}-\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}. Then, we have,\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\left|R\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)-R\\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq 2 e_{\\max } c^{2}} \\\\ {\\left|R\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)-\\widehat{R}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq e_{\\max } c^{2}} \\\\ {\\left|R\\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{o p t}\\right)-\\widehat{R}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{o p t}\\right)\\right| \\leq e_{\\max } c^{2}}\\end{array}\n\nNow we show the convergence rate of e_{\\max}=|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}-\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}. If for a sufficiently large x,\n\n\\max _{i, j} P\\left\\{b_{T}\\left|\\sigma_{i j}-\\hat{\\sigma}_{i j}\\right|>x\\right\\}\nfor some positive constants a and C and rate b_{T}, then\n\n|\\Sigma-\\hat{\\Sigma}|_{\\infty}=O_{P}\\left(\\frac{(\\log p)^{a}}{b_{T}}\\right)\n\nMoreover, suppose that \\left\\|R_{t}\\right\\|_{\\infty} is bounded and that the returns are weakly dependent in that its \\alpha mixing coefficient \\alpha(q) decays exponentially, namely \\alpha(q)= O\\left(\\exp \\left(-C q^{1 / b}\\right)\\right) for some b. If \\log p=o\\left(n^{1 /(2 b+1)}\\right), then we have the above convergence rate. (See Fan, Zhang and Yu (2012))\nTo better understand why the gross-exposure constraint helps on risk approximation, we make connections with covariance regularization. By the Lagrange multiplier method, our previous risk profile optimization is,\n\n\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w} / 2+\\lambda_{1}\\left(\\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1}-c\\right)+\\lambda_{2}\\left(1-\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\nLet g be the sub-gradient vector of the function \\|w\\|_{1}, whose i^{t h} element is -1, 1 or any values in [-1,1] depending on whether w_{i} is positive, negative or zero, respectively. Then, the first order condition is\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} \\boldsymbol{w}+\\lambda_{1} \\boldsymbol{g}-\\lambda_{2} \\mathbf{1}=0} \\\\ {\\lambda_{1}\\left(c-\\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1}\\right)=0, \\quad \\lambda_{1} \\geqslant 0}\\end{array}\n\nin addition to the constraints \\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1 and \\|\\boldsymbol{w}\\|_{1} \\leqslant c. Let \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{w}} be the solution. We can show that it is also the solution to the unconstrained portfolio optimization problem\n\n\\min _{\\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}=1} \\boldsymbol{w}^{\\top} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{c} \\boldsymbol{w}\n\nin which, with \\tilde{g} being the gradient evaluated at \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{w}},\n\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{c}=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}+\\lambda_{1}\\left(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{g}} \\mathbf{1}^{\\top}+\\mathbf{1} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{g}}^{\\top}\\right)\n\nWe now show the link between regression and risk profile optimization. Set R_p = Y, X_j = R_j - R_p, we have\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{var}(\\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{R})\n&= \\min_b \\mathbb{E} \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{R} - b\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= \\min_b \\mathbb{E} \\left(Y - w_1 X_1 - \\cdots - w_{p-1} X_{p-1} - b\\right)^2 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\nand the constraint on gross-exposure can be replaced by a similar L_1 norm.\n4. Chapter 8 Consumption based CAPM\n4.1. CCAPM\nRepresentative consumer consumes on a representative good with quantity C_{t} and price\np_{t} at time t. His income consists of external income I_{t} and \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t} shares on stocks with price \\boldsymbol{S}_{t}.

Mean-variance frontier\nValue of a portfolio: W_{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{T} \\boldsymbol{S}_{t}. Let W_{t+1}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{T} \\boldsymbol{S}_{t+1}. Then from CCAPM, \\boldsymbol{S}_{t}=\\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1} \\boldsymbol{S}_{t+1} and,\n\n\\begin{aligned} W_{t} &=\\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1} W_{t+1} \\\\ &=\\operatorname{Cov}_{t}\\left(M_{t+1}, W_{t+1}\\right)+\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1}\\right)\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{t} W_{t+1}\\right) \\end{aligned}\n\nTherefore, we have\n\n\\mathbb{E}_{t} W_{t+1}-\\left(1+r_{f, t+1}\\right) W_{t}=\\operatorname{Cov}_{t}\\left(M_{t+1}, W_{t+1}\\right)\\left(1+r_{f, t+1}\\right)\n\nBy the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,\n\n\\frac{\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{t} W_{t+1}-\\left(1+r_{f, t+1}\\right) W_{t}\\right)^{2}}{\\operatorname{var}_{t}\\left(W_{t+1}\\right)} \\leq \\frac{\\operatorname{var}_{t}\\left(M_{t+1}\\right)}{\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1}\\right)^{2}}\n\nEfficient frontier: Excess gain (return) per unit risk (the Sharpe ratio) is bounded by \\operatorname{var}_{t}\\left(M_{t+1}\\right) / \\left(\\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1}\\right)^{2}, which is not always achievable. Because M_{t+1}=\\frac{\\delta U^{\\prime}\\left(C_{t+1}\\right) p_{t}}{U^{\\prime}\\left(C_{t}\\right) p_{t+1}} which is not tradable. If we can construct a stochastic discount factor using tradable portfolio, we can assure the efficient frontier can be achieved.\nConsider M_{t+1}^{*}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{* T} \\boldsymbol{S}_{t+1} where \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{*} minimizes\n\n\\mathbb{E}_{t}\\left(M_{t+1}-\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{T} \\boldsymbol{S}_{t+1}\\right)^{2}\n\nThe first order condition yields the Euler condition,\n\n\\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1}^{*} \\boldsymbol{S}_{t+1}=\\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1} \\boldsymbol{S}_{t+1}=\\boldsymbol{S}_{t}\n\nTherefore, we have \\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1}^{*} \\boldsymbol{S}_{t+1} = \\boldsymbol{S}_{t}, \\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1}^*=\\left(1+r_{f, t+1}\\right)^{-1} and we can derive the above upper bound for Sharpe ratio again using M_{t+1}^*,\n\n\\frac{\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{t} W_{t+1}-\\left(1+r_{f, t+1}\\right) W_{t}\\right)^{2}}{\\operatorname{var}_{t}\\left(W_{t+1}\\right)} \\leq \\frac{\\operatorname{var}_{t}\\left(M_{t+1}^{*}\\right)}{\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{t} M_{t+1}^{*}\\right)^{2}}\n\nObviously, M_{t+1}^* attains the maximum Sharpe ratio, which is called the benchmark portfolio.

Dynamic Programming\nThe term dynamic programming (DP) refers to a collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the environment as a Markov decision process (MDP). In Dynamic Programming, we know exactly what the model is, that is p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right), \\text { for all } s \\in \\mathcal{S} \\text { and } a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s).\n3.1. Policy Evaluation\n\n3.2. Policy Improvement\nPolicy improvement theorem: Let \\pi and \\pi^{\\prime} be any pair of deterministic policies such that, for all s \\in \\mathcal{S},\n\nq_{\\pi}\\left(s, \\pi^{\\prime}(s)\\right) \\geq v_{\\pi}(s)\n\nthen for all s \\in \\mathcal{S},\n\nv_{\\pi^{\\prime}}(s) \\geq v_{\\pi}(s)\n\nTherefore, the new greedy policy \\pi^\\prime is given by\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi^{\\prime}(s)\n& \\doteq \\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&=\\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\;  S_{t}=s, A_{t}=a\\right] \\\\\n&=\\underset{a}{\\arg \\max } \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\;  s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nIf the new policy \\pi^\\prime is just as good as the old one \\pi, then \\pi^\\prime is the optimal policy (satisfies Bellman optimal equation):\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{\\pi^{\\prime}}(s)\n&=\\max _{a} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\pi^{\\prime}}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\;  S_{t}=s, A_{t}=a\\right] \\\\\n&=\\max _{a} \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v_{\\pi^{\\prime}}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\n3.3. Policy Iteration\nCombine policy evaluation and policy improvement together, we have:\n\n3.4. Value Iteration\nOne drawback to policy iteration is that each of its iterations involves policy evaluation, which may itself be a protracted iterative computation requiring multiple sweeps through the state set.\nWe can consider using policy evaluation where it stops after just one sweep (one update of each state). This algorithm is called value iteration.\n\n4. Monte Carlo Methods\n4.1. Monte Carlo Prediction\n\nIf a model is not available, then it is particularly useful to estimate action values (the values of state–action pairs) rather than state values. With a model (in DP case), state values alone are sufficient to determine a policy; one simply looks ahead one step and chooses whichever action leads to the best combination of reward and next state.\n4.2. Monte Carlo Control\nThe algorithm is similar with DP case. However, we need to ensure all state-action pairs have a chance to be visited.\n\nWe can eliminate the exploring start assumption by using a \\epsilon-soft policy as follows:\n\nIt can be shown that\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{\\pi}\\left(s, \\pi^{\\prime}(s)\\right)\n&=\\sum_{a} \\pi^{\\prime}(a | s) q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+(1-\\varepsilon) \\max _{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&\\geq \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+(1-\\varepsilon) \\sum_{a} \\frac{\\pi(a | s)-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|}}{1-\\varepsilon} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{|\\mathcal{A}(s)|} \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a)+\\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\\n&= v_{\\pi}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere the greater or equal is because the sum is a weighted average with nonnegative weights summing to 1, and as such it must be less than or equal to the largest number averaged.\nBy the policy improvement theorem \\pi^\\prime is better than \\pi and equality can hold only when both \\pi^\\prime and \\pi are optimal among the \\epsilon-soft policies, that is, when they are better than or equal to all other \\epsilon-soft policies.\n4.3. Off-policy Prediction and Control via Importance Sampling\nA more straightforward approach is to use two policies, one that is learned about and that becomes the optimal policy, and one that is more exploratory and is used to generate behavior. The policy being learned about is called the target policy, and the policy used to generate behavior is called the behavior policy. In this case we say that learning is from data off'' the target policy, and the overall process is termedoff''-policy learning.\nConsider the target policy \\pi and the behavior policy b, under \\pi, the state-action trajectory start from S_t has the probability,\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left\\{A_{t}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}, \\ldots, S_{T} \\; | \\; S_{t}, A_{t: T-1} \\sim \\pi\\right\\}} \\\\ {\\quad=\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right) p\\left(S_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) \\cdots p\\left(S_{T} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}\\right)} \\\\ {\\quad=\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}\\end{array}\n\nthe relative probability of the trajectory under the target and behavior policies is\n\n\\rho_{t: T-1} \\doteq \\frac{\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}{\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right) p\\left(S_{k+1} \\; | \\; S_{k}, A_{k}\\right)}=\\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E} \\left[G_t \\; | \\; S_t\\right] = v_b(s), \\; \\; \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t} | S_{t}=s\\right]=v_{\\pi}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTo estimate v_\\pi(s), we simply scale the returns by the ratios and average the results:\n\nV(s) \\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} G_{t}}{|\\mathcal{T}(s)|}, \\; \\text{ or } \\; V(s) \\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} G_{t}}{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1}}\n\nwhere \\mathcal{T}(s) would only include time steps that were first visits to s within their episodes.\nThe incremental implementation of off-policy Monte Carlo evaluation is shown below, where C(S_t, A_t) is the cumulative weights.\n\nThe corresponding off-policy MC control algorithm is as follows.\n\nNotice that \\pi(S_t) is taken as a greedy policy and only when it coincides with the path of policy $b$, the update will continue within a episode. Therefore, \\pi(A_t | S_t) = 1.\n4.4. Optimize the Off-policy Importance Sampling\nDefine flat partial returns:\n\n\\bar{G}_{t: h} \\doteq R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+\\cdots+R_{h}, \\quad 0 \\leq t\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{aligned} G_{t}\n&\\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\gamma^{2} R_{t+3}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T} \\\\\n&=(1-\\gamma) R_{t+1} \\\\\n&\\quad +(1-\\gamma) \\gamma\\left(R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}\\right) \\\\\n&\\quad +(1-\\gamma) \\gamma^{2}\\left(R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+R_{t+3}\\right) \\\\\n&\\quad \\vdots \\\\\n&\\quad +(1-\\gamma) \\gamma^{T-t-2}\\left(R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+\\cdots+R_{T-1}\\right) \\\\\n&\\quad +\\gamma^{T-t-1}\\left(R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+\\cdots+R_{T}\\right) \\\\\n&= (1-\\gamma) \\sum_{h=t+1}^{T-1} \\gamma^{h-t-1} \\bar{G}_{t: h}+\\gamma^{T-t-1} \\bar{G}_{t: T} \\end{aligned}\n\nAnd the ordinary importance-sampling estimator and weighted importance-sampling estimator can be written as,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nV(s) &\\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)}\\left((1-\\gamma) \\sum_{h=t+1}^{T(t)-1} \\gamma^{h-t-1} \\rho_{t: h-1} \\bar{G}_{t: h}+\\gamma^{T(t)-t-1} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} \\bar{G}_{t: T(t)}\\right)}{|\\mathcal{T}(s)|} \\\\\nV(s) &\\doteq \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)}\\left((1-\\gamma) \\sum_{h=t+1}^{T(t)-1} \\gamma^{h-t-1} \\rho_{t: h-1} \\bar{G}_{t: h}+\\gamma^{T(t)-t-1} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1} \\bar{G}_{t: T(t)}\\right)}{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)}\\left((1-\\gamma) \\sum_{h=t+1}^{T(t)-1} \\gamma^{h-t-1} \\rho_{t: h-1}+\\gamma^{T(t)-t-1} \\rho_{t: T(t)-1}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe essence of the idea is to think of discounting as determining a probability of termination or, equivalently, a degree of partial termination. Therefore, the variance of importance sampling can be reduced.\nIn the off-policy estimators, each term of the sum in the numerator is itself a sum:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t}\n&=\\rho_{t: T-1}\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere\n\n\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}=\\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t+2} \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t+2} \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right)} \\cdots \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{T-1} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{T-1} \\; | \\; S_{T-1}\\right)} R_{t+1}\n\nWe can show that,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+1}\\right] &=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: t} R_{t+1}\\right] \\\\\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} R_{t+k}\\right] &=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: t+k-1} R_{t+k}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThus,\n\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t: T-1} G_{t}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\tilde{G}_{t}\\right]\n\nwhere\n\n\\tilde{G}_{t} = \\rho_{t: t} R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t: t+1} R_{t+2}+\\gamma^{2} \\rho_{t: t+2} R_{t+3}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} \\rho_{t: T-1} R_{T}\n\nand the ordinary/weighted average of returns can be defined accordingly. This method, known as Per-decision Importance Sampling, is useful to reduce the variance of importance sampling.\n5. Temporal-Difference Learning\n5.1. TD(0) Learning: On-policy\nWe know that\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{\\pi}(s)\n&\\doteq \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}=s\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma G_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t}=s\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\; S_{t}=s\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTD(0) is a one-step bootstrap method which plug-in the current estimation of value function.\n\nThe TD(0) control algorithm (a.k.a. Sarsa) is\n\nThe convergence properties of the Sarsa algorithm depend on the nature of the policy’s dependence on Q. For example, one could use \\epsilon-greedy policies. Sarsa converges with probability 1 to an optimal policy and action-value function as long as all state–action pairs are visited an infinite number of times and the policy converges in the limit to the greedy policy.\n5.2. Q-learning: Off-policy TD Control\nNotice that in TD(0) algorithm above, the step we take is based on current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t) and the bootstrap method we used to update Q(S_t,A_t) is also based on current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t). We can consider a off-policy control algorithm decouple the update from current estimation of Q(S_t, A_t).\n\nQ\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\max _{a} Q\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\n\nWe may also use expected value instead of maximum one:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\n&\\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[Q\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right) \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right]-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&\\leftarrow Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)-Q\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\n5.3. Double-Q Learning\nIn Q-learning the target policy is the greedy policy given the current action values, which is defined with a max, and in Sarsa the policy is often \\epsilon-greedy, which also involves a maximization operation. In these algorithms, a maximum over estimated values is used implicitly as an estimate of the maximum value, which can lead to a significant positive bias.\nWe can consider using two policy together and update one and only one of them each time.\n\n6. n-step Bootstrapping\n6.1. n-step On-policy learning\nThe complete return is\n\nG_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\gamma^{2} R_{t+3}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T}\n\nIn one-step updates the target is the first reward plus the discounted estimated value of the next state, which we call the one-step return:\n\nG_{t: t+1} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma V_{t}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)\n\nSimilarly, we can define n-step return as\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n}+\\gamma^{n} V_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t+n}\\right)\n\nThe n-step return has a better prediction error than one-step return under worst case:\n\n\\max _{s}\\left|\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t: t+n} \\; | \\; S_{t}=s\\right]-v_{\\pi}(s)\\right| \\leq \\gamma^{n} \\max _{s}\\left|V_{t+n-1}(s)-v_{\\pi}(s)\\right|\n\n\nand the n-step Sarsa can be derived similarly.\n\n6.2. n-step Off-policy Learning\nConsider the target policy \\pi and the behavior policy b. Define\n\n\\rho_{t: h} \\doteq \\prod_{k=t}^{\\min (h, T-1)} \\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{k} \\; | \\; S_{k}\\right)}\n\nTherefore, the off-policy n-step Sarsa is as follows.\n\n6.3. Per-decision Methods with Control Variates\nFor the n steps ending at horizon h, the n-step return can be written\n\nG_{t: h}=R_{t+1}+\\gamma G_{t+1: h}\n\nwith G_{h: h} \\doteq V_{h-1}\\left(S_{h}\\right). All of the resulting experience, including the first reward R_{t+1} and the next state S_{t+1} must be weighted by the importance sampling ratio for time t, \\rho_{t}=\\frac{\\pi\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}{b\\left(A_{t} \\; | \\; S_{t}\\right)}. If \\rho_t is zero, a simple weighting would result in the n-step return being zero, which could result in high variance when it was used as a target. Instead, consider\n\nG_{t: h} \\doteq \\rho_{t}\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma G_{t+1: h}\\right)+\\left(1-\\rho_{t}\\right) V_{h-1}\\left(S_{t}\\right)\n\nIf \\rho_t is zero, we just use current value to update (which causes no change), and since the expected value of \\rho_t is 1, this above update rule does not change the expected update.\nFor n-step expected Sarsa with the following rule:\n\nQ_{t+n}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\doteq Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)+\\alpha \\rho_{t+1: t+n}\\left[G_{t: t+n}-Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\nwe can write its corresponding control covariate method as\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nG_{t: h}\n&\\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma\\left(\\rho_{t+1} G_{t+1: h}+\\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-\\rho_{t+1} Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\rho_{t+1}\\left(G_{t+1: h}-Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right)\\right)+\\gamma \\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right), \\quad t\nwhen \\rho_t = 0, we use the off-policy expectation \\bar{V}_{t}(s) \\doteq \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) Q_{t}(s, a) to make the update. And the expectation of \\bar{V}_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-\\rho_{t+1} Q_{h-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\right) is zero.\n6.4. Off-policy Learning Without Importance Sampling: The n-step Tree Backup Algorithm\nWe consider a off-policy without importance sampling. In n-step off-policy Sarsa, we estimate R_{t+j}, 1 \\leq j \\leq n using the reward from another policy b. We now consider estimate this return with expected value over all actions except the action we take.\nThe one-step return (target) is the same as that of Expected Sarsa,\n\nG_{t: t+1} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)\n\nfor t  and the two-step tree-backup return is\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nG_{t: t+2} &\\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma\n \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)\n\\\\ &\\quad \\quad \\quad \\; \\; +\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right)\\left(R_{t+2}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+2}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+2}, a\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&= R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)+\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) G_{t+1: t+2} \\end{aligned}\n\nThe latter form suggests the general recursive definition of the tree-backup n-step return:\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a \\neq A_{t+1}} \\pi\\left(a \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) Q_{t+n-1}\\left(S_{t+1}, a\\right)+\\gamma \\pi\\left(A_{t+1} \\; | \\; S_{t+1}\\right) G_{t+1: t+n}\n\nThis can be illustrated from the backup diagram below.\n\nand the n-step tree-backup algorithm for control is:\n\n6.5. A Unifying Algorithm\nConsider unifying the importance sampling with tree-backup algorithm.

Policy Gradient for Continuing Problems Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2)\n1. On-policy Prediction with Approximation\n1.1. Stochastic-gradient and Semi-gradient Methods for On-policy Approximation\nGiven a state distribution \\mu(s) \\geq 0, \\; \\sum \\mu(s) = 1, we obtain a natural objective function, the Mean Squared Value Error, denoted \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}:\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}(\\mathbf{w}) \\doteq \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mu(s)\\left[v_{\\pi}(s)-\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w})\\right]^{2}\n\nUsing stochastic gradient-descent (SGD),\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\n&\\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla\\left[v_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\\right]^{2} \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left[v_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTherefore, the SGD version for Monte Carlo state-value prediction algorithm is as follows.\n\nIf we use bootstrapping estimate of v_\\pi(S_t) such as n-step TD, then this estimate relies on the current weights \\mathbf{w}_{t} and the expression above is biased and will not produce true gradient descent. We call this kind of methods as semi-gradient methods.\n\n1.2. Linear Methods\nDenote \\boldsymbol{x}(s) as the feature vector for state s \\in \\mathcal{S}. Linear methods approximate state-value function by the inner product between \\mathbf{w} and \\mathbf{x}(s):\n\n\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w}) \\doteq \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}(s) \\doteq \\sum_{i=1}^{d} w_{i} x_{i}(s)\n\nThus, in the linear case the general SGD update reduces to a particularly simple form:\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left[U_{t}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\\right] \\mathbf{x}\\left(S_{t}\\right)\n\nThe semi-gradient TD(0) algorithm presented in the previous section also converges under linear function approximation, but this does not follow from general results on SGD; a separate theorem is necessary. The weight vector converged to is also not the global optimum, but rather a point near the local optimum.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\n&\\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}-\\mathbf{w}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t} \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(R_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right) \\end{aligned}\n\nOnce the system has reached steady state, for any given \\mathbf{w}_{t}, the expected next weight vector can be written\n\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\; | \\; \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right]=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\n\nwhere\n\n\\mathbf{b} \\doteq \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathbf{A} \\doteq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right)^{\\top}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n\nif the system converges, it must converge to the weight vector \\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{TD}} \\doteq \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{b} which is called the TD fixed point. In fact linear semi-gradient TD(0) converges to this point.\nAt the TD fixed point, it has also been proven (in the continuing case) that the \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}} is within a bounded expansion of the lowest possible error:\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{TD}}\\right) \\leq \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma} \\min _{\\mathbf{w}} \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}(\\mathbf{w})\n\nThe semi-gradient n-step TD algorithm is the natural extension of the tabular n-step TD algorithm presented to semi-gradient function approximation.\n\nwhere the n-step return is generalized as\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n}+\\gamma^{n} \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+n}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq T-n\n\n1.3. Feature Construction for Linear Methods\nPolynomials\nFourier Basis\nRadial Basis Functions\n\nx_{i}(s) \\doteq \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\left\\|s-c_{i}\\right\\|^{2}}{2 \\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right)\n\nKernel-based Function\nCoarse Coding：\nConsider a task in which the natural representation of the state set is a continuous two- dimensional space. One kind of representation for this case is made up of features corresponding to circles in state space, as shown to the right. If the state is inside a circle, then the corresponding feature has the value 1 and is said to be present; otherwise the feature is 0 and is said to be absent. This kind of 1–0-valued feature is called a binary feature. Given a state, which binary features are present indicate within which circles the state lies, and thus coarsely code for its location. Representing a state with features that overlap in this way (although they need not be circles or binary) is known as coarse coding.\n\nTile Coding\nTile coding is a form of coarse coding for multi-dimensional continuous spaces that is\nflexible and computationally efficient. It may be the most practical feature representation\nfor modern sequential digital computers. In tile coding the receptive fields of the features are grouped into partitions of the state space. Each such partition is called a tiling, and each element of the partition is called a tile.\n\n1.4. Nonlinear Function Approximation: Artificial Neural Networks\n1.5. Least-Squares TD\nRecall TD fixed point\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{\\mathrm{TD}} \\doteq \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{b}\n\nwhere\n\n\\mathbf{b} \\doteq \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathbf{A} \\doteq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right)^{\\top}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n\nThe Least-Squares TD algorithm, commonly known as LSTD, forms the natural estimates\n\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t} \\doteq \\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} \\mathbf{x}_{k}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{k}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{k+1}\\right)^{\\top}+\\varepsilon \\mathbf{I} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}_{t} \\doteq \\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} R_{k+1} \\mathbf{x}_{k}\n\nwhere LSTD uses these estimates to estimate the TD fixed point as\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t} \\doteq \\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t}^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}_{t}\n\nIn LSTD, the inverse of \\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t}, and the computational complexity of a general inverse computation is O\\left(d^{3}\\right). Fortunately, an inverse of a matrix of our special form - a sum of outer products - can also be updated incrementally with only O\\left(d^{2}\\right) computations, as\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t}^{-1}\n&=\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right)^{\\top}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n&=\\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t-1}^{-1}-\\frac{\\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t-1}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right)^{\\top} \\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t-1}^{-1}}{1+\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right)^{\\top} \\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t-1}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}} \\end{aligned}\n\nfor t>0, with \\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{0} \\doteq \\varepsilon \\mathbf{I}. Although the identity known as the Sherman-Morrison formula, is superficially complicated, it involves only vector-matrix and vector-vector multiplications and thus is only O\\left(d^{2}\\right). Thus we can store the inverse matrix \\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}_{t}^{-1}\nmaintain it and use it all with only O\\left(d^{2}\\right) memory and per-step computation. The complete algorithm is given below.\n\n2. On-policy Control with Approximation\n2.1.

Average Reward: A New Problem Setting for Continuing Tasks\nIn the average-reward setting, the quality of a policy \\pi is defined as the average rate of\nreward, or simply average reward, while following that policy, which we denote as r(\\pi):\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nr(\\pi)\n& \\doteq \\lim _{h \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{t=1}^{h} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t}  \\; | \\; S_{0}, A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right] \\\\\n&=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t} \\; | \\; S_{0}, A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right] \\\\\n&=\\sum_{s} \\mu_{\\pi}(s) \\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\; | \\; s) \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right) r \\end{aligned}\n\nwhere the expectations are conditioned on the initial state, S_{0}, and on the subsequent\nactions, A_{0}, A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{t-1}, being taken according to \\pi. \\mu_{\\pi} is the steady-state distribution, \\mu_{\\pi}(s) \\doteq \\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left\\{S_{t}=s \\; | \\; A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right\\}, which is assumed to exist for any \\pi and to be independent of S_{0}. This assumption about the MDP is known as ergodicity.\nNote that the steady state distribution is the special distribution under which, if you select actions according to \\pi, you remain in the same distribution. That is, for which\n\n\\sum_{s} \\mu_{\\pi}(s) \\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\; | \\; s) p\\left(s^{\\prime} \\; | \\; s, a\\right)=\\mu_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\n\nIn the average-reward setting, returns are defined in terms of differences between rewards and the average reward:\n\nG_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}-r(\\pi)+R_{t+2}-r(\\pi)+R_{t+3}-r(\\pi)+\\cdots\n\nWe simply remove all \\gammas and replace all rewards by the difference between the reward and the true average reward:\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{v_{\\pi}(s)=\\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) \\sum_{r, s^{\\prime}} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right)\\left[r-r(\\pi)+v_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]} \\\\ {q_{\\pi}(s, a)=\\sum_{r, s^{\\prime}} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right)\\left[r-r(\\pi)+\\sum_{a^{\\prime}} \\pi\\left(a^{\\prime} | s^{\\prime}\\right) q_{\\pi}\\left(s^{\\prime}, a^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]} \\\\ {v_{*}(s)=\\max _{a} \\sum_{r, s^{\\prime}} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right)\\left[r-\\max _{\\pi} r(\\pi)+v_{*}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]} \\\\ {q_{*}(s, a)=\\sum_{r, s^{\\prime}} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right)\\left[r-\\max _{\\pi} r(\\pi)+\\max _{a^{\\prime}} q_{*}\\left(s^{\\prime}, a^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]}\\end{array}\n\n\n2.3. Differential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa\nWe begin by generalizing the n-step return to its differential form, with function approximation:\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}-\\bar{R}_{t+1}+R_{t+2}-\\bar{R}_{t+2}+\\cdots+R_{t+n}-\\bar{R}_{t+n}+\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right)\n\nwhere \\bar{R} is an estimate of r(\\pi), n \\geq 1. Pseudocode for the complete algorithm is given in the box.\n\nwhere\n\n\\delta_{t} \\doteq G_{t: t+n}-\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\n\n3. Off-policy Methods with Approximation\n3.1. Semi-gradient Methods\nThe one-step, state-value algorithm is semi-gradient off-policy TD(0)\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\n\nwhere \\delta_{t} is defined appropriately depending on whether the problem is episodic and\ndiscounted, or continuing and undiscounted using average reward:\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\delta_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right), \\text { or }} \\\\ {\\delta_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}-\\bar{R}_{t}+\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)}\\end{array}\n\nFor action values, the one-step algorithm is semi-gradient Expected Sarsa:\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+n} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}+\\alpha \\rho_{t+1} \\cdots \\rho_{t+n-1}\\left[G_{t: t+n}-\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right)\n\nwhere\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\delta_{t} & \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a | S_{t+1}\\right) \\hat{q}\\left(S_{t+1}, a, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right), & \\text { or } & \\text { (episodic) } \\\\ \\delta_{t} & \\doteq R_{t+1}-\\bar{R}_{t}+\\sum \\pi\\left(a | S_{t+1}\\right) \\hat{q}\\left(S_{t+1}, a, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{q}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right) & & \\text { (continuing) } \\end{aligned}\n\nYou can find the multi-step generalizations of these algorithms in a similar manner.\n3.2. Examples of Off-policy Divergence\nConsider estimating the state-value under the linear parameterization indicated by\nthe expression shown in each state circle. For example, the estimated value of the\nleftmost state is 2 w_{1}+w_{8}, where the subscript corresponds to the component of the overall weight vector \\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{8}; this corresponds to a feature vector for the first state being \\mathbf{x}(1)=(2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)^{\\top}. The reward is zero on all transitions, so the true value function is v_{\\pi}(s)=0, for all s, which can be exactly approximated if \\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{0}. In fact, there are many solutions, as there are more components to the weight vector ( 8) than there are nonterminal states (7). Moreover, the set of feature vectors, \\{\\mathbf{x}(s): s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\}, is a linearly independent set. In all these ways this task seems a favorable case for linear function approximation.\n\nIf we apply semi-gradient TD(0) to this problem, then the weights diverge to infinity. The instability occurs for any positive step size, no matter how small. In fact, it even occurs if an expected update is done as in dynamic programming (DP).\nIf we alter just the distribution of DP updates in Baird’s counterexample, from the uniform distribution to the on-policy distribution (which generally requires asynchronous updating), then convergence is guaranteed. The example shows that even the simplest combination of bootstrapping and function approximation can be unstable if the updates are not done according to the on-policy distribution.\nThere are also counterexamples similar to Baird’s showing divergence for Q-learning.\nOur discussion so far can be summarized by saying that the danger of instability and divergence arises whenever we combine all of the following three elements, making up what we call the deadly triad:\n\nFunction approximation A powerful, scalable way of generalizing from a state space much larger than the memory and computational resources;\n\nBootstrapping Update targets that include existing estimates (as in dynamic programming or TD methods) rather than relying exclusively on actual rewards and complete returns (as in MC methods).\n\nOff-policy training Training on a distribution of transitions other than that produced by the target policy. Sweeping through the state space and updating all states uniformly, as in dynamic programming, does not respect the target policy and is an example of off-policy training.\n\n\n3.3. Linear Value-function Geometry\nWe can define the distance between value functions using the norm\n\n\\|v\\|_{\\mu}^{2} \\doteq \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mu(s) v(s)^{2}\n\nNotice that \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}} we use for semi-gradient method is,\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}(\\mathbf{w}) \\doteq \\sum_{s \\in S} \\mu(s)\\left[v_{\\pi}(s)-\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w})\\right]^{2} = \\left\\|v_{\\mathbf{w}}-v_{\\pi}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2}\n\nWe define a projection operator \\Pi that takes an arbitrary value function to the representable function that is closest in our norm:\n\n\\Pi v \\doteq v_{\\mathrm{w}} \\quad \\text { where } \\quad \\mathrm{w}=\\underset{\\mathrm{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}}{\\arg \\min }\\left\\|v-v_{\\mathrm{w}}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2}\n\nFor a linear function approximator, the projection operation is linear, which implies that it can be represented as an |\\mathcal{S}| \\times |\\mathcal{S}| matrix:\n\n\\Pi \\doteq \\mathbf{X}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D}\n\nwhere \\mathbf{D} is the |\\mathcal{S}| \\times |\\mathcal{S}| matrix with \\mu(s) the diagonal element, and \\mathbf{X} denotes the |\\mathcal{S}| \\times d matrix whose rows are the feature vectors \\mathbf{x}(s)^{\\top}, one for each state s.\nRecall the Bellman equation for value function, we define Bellman error at state s,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}(s)\n& \\doteq\\left(\\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v_{\\mathbf{w}}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\\right)-v_{\\mathbf{w}}(s) \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma v_{\\mathbf{w}}\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-v_{\\mathbf{w}}\\left(S_{t}\\right) \\; | \\; S_{t}=s, A_{t} \\sim \\pi\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nTherefore, the Mean Squared Bellman Error is,\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{BE}}(\\mathbf{w})=\\left\\|\\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2}\n\nThe Bellman error vector is a result of applying the Bellman operator B_{\\pi}: \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}|} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}|} to the approximate value function. The Bellman operator is,\n\n\\left(B_{\\pi} v\\right)(s) \\doteq \\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\; | \\; s) \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r \\; | \\; s, a\\right)\\left[r+\\gamma v\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]\n\nThe Bellman error vector for v can be written \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}=B_{\\pi} v_{\\mathbf{w}}-v_{\\mathbf{w}}.\nIf the Bellman operator is applied to a value function in the representable subspace, then, in general, it will produce a new value function that is outside the subspace. In dynamic programming (without function approximation), this operator is applied repeatedly to the points outside the representable space. Eventually that process converges to the true value function v_\\pi, the only fixed point for the Bellman operator.\nWith function approximation, however, the intermediate value functions lying outside the subspace cannot be represented. In this case we are interested in the projection of the Bellman error vector back into the representable space. This is the projected Bellman error vector \\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{v_{\\mathrm{w}}}. Thus, we define the Mean Square Projected Bellman Error,\n\n\\overline{\\operatorname{PBE}}(\\mathbf{w})=\\left\\|\\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2}\n\n3.4. Gradient Descent in the Bellman Error\nThe one-step TD error with discounting is\n\n\\delta_{t}=R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{w}_{t+1} &=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\delta_{t}\\right]^{2}\\right) \\\\ &=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right]^{2}\\right) \\\\ &\\left.=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\alpha \\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right] \\nabla \\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right] \\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\nabla \\delta_{t}\\right] \\\\ &=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left[\\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right)\\right]-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right]\\left[\\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}_{b}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right]\\right] \\end{aligned}\n\nThis update and various ways of sampling it are referred to as the residual-gradient algorithm. If you simply used the sample values in all the expectations, the equation above involves the next state, S_{t+1}, appearing in two expectations that are multiplied together. To get an unbiased sample of the product, two independent samples of the next state are required, but during normal interaction with an external environment only one is obtained. One expectation or the other can be sampled, but not both.\n3.5. The Bellman Error is Not Learnable\nIn reinforcement learning, a hypothesis is said to be ``learnable'' if it can be learned with any amount of experience. It turns out many quantities of apparent interest in reinforcement learning cannot be learned even from an infinite amount of experiential data. These quantities are well defined and can be computed given knowledge of the internal structure of the environment, but cannot be computed or estimated from the observed sequence of feature vectors, actions, and rewards.\nThere are counterexamples where the optimal parameter vector of \\overline{BE} is not a function of the data and thus cannot be learned from it. However, another bootstrapping objective that we have considered, the \\overline{\\mathrm{PBE}}, can be determined from data (are learnable) and determine optimal solution that is in general different from the $\\overline{\\mathrm{BE}}$ minimums.\n3.6. Gradient-TD Methods\nRemember that in the linear case there is always an exact solution, the TD fixed point w_{TD}, at which the \\overline{\\mathrm{PBE}} is zero. This solution could be found by least-squares methods but only by methods of quadratic O\\left(d^{2}\\right) complexity in the number of parameters. We seek instead an SGD method.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\overline{\\operatorname{PBE}}(\\mathbf{w})\n&=\\left\\|\\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right\\|_{\\mu}^{2} \\\\\n&=\\left(\\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\\\ &=\\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}^{\\top} \\Pi^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\Pi \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\\\\n&=\\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\\\\n&=\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right)^{\\top}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe gradient with respect to \\mathbf{w} is\n\n\\nabla \\overline{\\mathrm{PBE}}(\\mathbf{w})=2 \\nabla\\left[\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right]^{\\top}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{D} \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{w}}\\right)\n\nTo turn this into an SGD method, we have to sample something on every time step that has this quantity as its expected value.

It is the solution to a linear\nleast-squares problem that tries to approximate \\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} from the features. The standard SGD method for incrementally finding the vector \\mathbf{v} that minimizes the expected squared\nerror \\left(\\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right)^{2} is known as the Least Mean Square (LMS) rule:\n\n\\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{v}_{t}+\\beta \\rho_{t}\\left(\\delta_{t}-\\mathbf{v}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}\n\nTherefore, the GTD2 algorithm is,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla \\overline{\\operatorname{PBE}}\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha 2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}-\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&\\approx \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbf{v}_{t} \\\\\n& \\approx \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\rho_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nA slightly better algorithm can be derived by doing a few more analytic steps before substituting in \\mathbf{v}_t, which is called GTD(0) algorithm:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right]-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right]^{-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right]\\right) \\\\\n&\\approx \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\rho_{t} \\delta_{t}\\right]-\\gamma \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\rho_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top}\\right] \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right) \\\\\n&\\approx \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\rho_{t}\\left(\\delta_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\n4. Eligibility Traces\n4.1. TD-lambda\nRecall the n-step return,\n\nG_{t: t+n} \\doteq R_{t+1}+\\gamma R_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n}+\\gamma^{n} \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+n}, \\mathbf{w}_{t+n-1}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq T-n\n\nDefine the \\lambda-return as,\n\nG_{t}^{\\lambda} \\doteq(1-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{n-1} G_{t: t+n}\n\nwe can separate these post-termination terms from the main sum, yielding\n\nG_{t}^{\\lambda}=(1-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^{T-t-1} \\lambda^{n-1} G_{t: t+n}+\\lambda^{T-t-1} G_{t}\n\nas indicated in the figures. This equation makes it clearer what happens when \\lambda=1. In\nthis case the main sum goes to zero, and the remaining term reduces to the conventional return. Thus, for \\lambda=1, updating according to the \\lambda-return is a Monte Carlo algorithm. On the other hand, if \\lambda=0, then the \\lambda-return reduces to G_{t: t+1}, the one-step return.\nWe are now ready to define our first learning algorithm based on the \\lambda-return: the\noffline \\lambda-return algorithm. As an offline algorithm, it makes no changes to the weight vector during the episode. Then, at the end of the episode, a whole sequence of offline\nupdates are made according to our usual semi-gradient rule, using the \\lambda-return as the\ntarget:\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha\\left[G_{t}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right), \\quad t=0, \\ldots, T-1\n\nTD(\\lambda) is one of the oldest and most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning. TD (\\lambda) improves over the offline \\lambda-return algorithm in three ways. First it updates the weight vector on every step of an episode rather than only at the end, and thus its estimates may be better sooner. Second, its computations are equally distributed in time rather than all at the end of the episode. And third, it can be applied to\ncontinuing problems rather than just to episodic problems. In this section we present the\nsemi-gradient version of TD(\\lambda) with function approximation.\nIn \\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda), the eligibility trace vector is initialized to zero at the beginning of the episode, is incremented on each time step by the value gradient, and then fades away by \\gamma \\lambda:\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{z}_{-1} \\doteq \\mathbf{0}} \\\\ {\\mathbf{z}_{t} \\doteq \\gamma \\lambda \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}+\\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq T}\\end{array}\n\nwhere \\gamma is the discount rate and \\lambda is the parameter introduced in the previous section, which we henceforth call the trace-decay parameter. The eligibility trace keeps track of which components of the weight vector have contributed, positively or negatively, to recent state valuations, where \"recent\" is defined in terms of \\gamma \\lambda.\n\nWe also show below the backward or mechanistic view of TD(\\lambda). Each update depends on the current TD error combined with the current eligibility traces of past events.\n\nLinear \\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda) has been proved to converge in the on-policy case if the step-size parameter is reduced over time according to the usual conditions. For the continuing discounted case,\n\n\\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{\\infty}\\right) \\leq \\frac{1-\\gamma \\lambda}{1-\\gamma} \\min _{\\mathbf{w}} \\overline{\\mathrm{VE}}(\\mathbf{w})\n\nIn practice, however, \\lambda=1 is often the poorest choice.\n4.2. Online TD-lambda\nIn general, we define the truncated \\lambda-return for time t, given data only up to some later horizon, h, as\n\nG_{t:h}^{\\lambda} \\doteq(1-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^{h-t-1} \\lambda^{n-1} G_{t: t+n}+\\lambda^{h-t-1} G_{t:h}, \\quad 0 \\leq t\nThe conceptual algorithm involves multiple passes over the episode, one at each horizon, each generating a different sequence of weight vectors. Let us use w_t^h to denote the weights used to generate the value at time t in the sequence up to horizon h. The first weight vector w_0^h in each sequence is that inherited from the previous episode.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nh=1: \\quad &\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{1}+\\alpha\\left[G_{0: 1}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{1}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{1}\\right) \\\\\n \\\\\nh=2: \\quad & \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{2}+\\alpha\\left[G_{0: 2}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{2}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{2} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2}+\\alpha\\left[G_{1: 2}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{1}, \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{1}, \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2}\\right) \\\\\n \\\\\nh=3: \\quad & \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{3}+\\alpha\\left[G_{0: 3}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{3}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{0}, \\mathbf{w}_{0}^{3}\\right) \\\\ & \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3}+\\alpha\\left[G_{1: 3}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{1}, \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{1}, \\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3}\\right) \\\\ & \\mathbf{w}_{3}^{3} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3}+\\alpha\\left[G_{2: 3}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{2}, \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{2}, \\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe general form for the update is\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}^{h} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{h}+\\alpha\\left[G_{t: h}^{\\lambda}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{h}\\right)\\right] \\nabla \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{h}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t\nNow we are ready to introduce the true online TD(\\lambda). The sequence of weight vectors produced by the online \\lambda-return algorithm can be arranged in a triangle:\n\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}{\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{0}} & {} & {} & {} & {} \\\\ {\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{1}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{1}} & {} & {} \\\\ {\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{2}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{2}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{2}^{2}} & {} \\\\ {\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{3}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{3}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{2}^{3}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{3}^{3}} & {} \\\\ {} & {\\vdots} & {\\vdots} & {\\vdots} & {\\vdots} & {\\ddots} \\\\ {\\mathbf{w}_{0}^{T}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{1}^{T}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{2}^{T}} & {\\mathbf{w}_{3}^{T}} & {\\cdots} & {\\mathbf{w}_{T}^{T}}\\end{array}\n\nOne row of this triangle is produced on each time step. It turns out that the weight\nvectors on the diagonal, the w_t^t, are the only ones really needed. The strategy then is to find a compact, efficient way of computing each w_t^t from the one before. Pseudocode for the complete algorithm is given in the box.\n\nWe can define the action-value method (Sarsa(\\lambda)) similarly.

Stable Off-policy Methods with Traces\nSeveral methods using eligibility traces have been proposed that achieve guarantees of stability under off-policy training, and here we present two of the most important ones.\nGTD(\\lambda) is the eligibility-trace algorithm analogous to GTD(0) the better of the two state-value Gradient-TD prediction algorithms discussed above. Its goal is to learn a parameter \\mathbf{w}_{t} such that \\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w}) \\stackrel{\\vdots}{=} \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}(s) \\approx v_{\\pi}(s), even from data that is due to following another policy b. Its update is\n\n\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\delta_{t}^{s} \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\alpha \\gamma\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\n\nwhere\n\n\\mathbf{v}_{t+1} \\doteq \\mathbf{v}_{t}+\\beta \\delta_{t}^{s} \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\beta\\left(\\mathbf{v}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{x}_{t}\n\nGQ(\\lambda) is the Gradient-TD algorithm for action values with eligibility traces. Its goal is to learn a parameter \\mathbf{w}_{t} such that \\hat{q}\\left(s, a, \\mathbf{w}_{t}\\right) \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}(s, a) \\approx q_{\\pi}(s, a) from off-policy.

Its most appealing feature is that it is a strict generalization of \\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda) to off-policy learning, meaning that if the behavior policy happens to be the same as the target policy, then \\mathrm{HTD}(\\lambda) becomes the same as \\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda), which is not true for \\mathrm{GTD}(\\lambda). HTD(\\lambda) is defined as\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{w}_{t+1} & \\doteq \\mathbf{w}_{t}+\\alpha \\delta_{t}^{s} \\mathbf{z}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\mathbf{z}_{t}^{b}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right) \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_{t+1} & \\doteq \\mathbf{v}_{t}+\\beta \\delta_{t}^{s} \\mathbf{z}_{t}-\\beta\\left(\\mathbf{z}_{t}^{b} \\mathbf{v}_{t}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}-\\gamma \\mathbf{x}_{t+1}\\right), \\quad \\text { with } \\mathbf{v}_{0} \\doteq \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{z}_{t} & \\doteq \\rho_{t}\\left(\\gamma \\lambda \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right), \\quad \\text { with } \\mathbf{z}_{-1} \\doteq \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{z}_{t}^{b} & \\doteq \\gamma \\lambda \\mathbf{z}_{t-1}^{b}+\\mathbf{x}_{t}, \\quad \\text { with } \\mathbf{z}_{-1}^{b} \\doteq \\mathbf{0} \\end{aligned}\n\n5. Policy Gradient Methods\n5.1. Policy Approximation and the Policy Gradient Theorem\nIn this chapter we consider methods for learning the policy parameter based on the gradient of some scalar performance measure J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) with respect to the policy parameter. These methods seek to maximize performance, so their updates stochastic gradient ascent in J is\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha \\widehat{\\nabla J\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}\n\nIn policy gradient methods, the policy can be parameterized in any way, as long as \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) is differentiable with respect to its parameters.\nIf the action space is discrete and not too large, then a natural and common kind of parameterization is to form parameterized numerical preferences h(s, a, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\in \\mathbb{R} and the actions with the highest preferences in each state are given the highest probabilities of being selected. For example,\n\n\\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\doteq \\frac{e^{h(s, a, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})}}{\\sum_{b} e^{h(s, b, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})}}\n\nThe action preferences themselves can be parameterized arbitrarily. For example, they\nmight be computed by a deep artificial neural network, where \\boldsymbol{\\theta} is the vector of all the connection weights of the network. Or the preferences could simply be linear in features,\n\nh(s, a, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}(s, a)\n\nIn the episodic case we define performance as\n\nJ(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\doteq v_{\\pi_{\\theta}}\\left(s_{0}\\right)\n\nThere is an excellent theoretical answer to this challenge in the form of the policy gradient theorem, which provides an analytic expression for the gradient of performance with respect to the policy parameter. The policy gradient theorem for the episodic case establishes that\n\n\\nabla J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\propto \\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\nabla \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n\nThe proof of the policy gradient theorem is given below.\n\n5.2. REINFORCE: Monte Carlo Policy Gradient\nNotice that\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n&\\propto \\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\nabla \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{a} q_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}, a\\right) \\nabla \\pi\\left(a | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{a} \\pi\\left(a | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right) q_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}, a\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(a | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(a | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[q_{\\pi}\\left(S_{t}, A_{t}\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t} \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere we introduce A_t and replace a sum over the random variable’s possible values by an expectation under \\pi, and then sampling the expectation.\nUsing this sample to instantiate our generic stochastic gradient ascent algorithm yields the REINFORCE update:\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} \\doteq \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha G_{t} \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t} | S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}\n\nwhere G_t is obtained by Monte-Carlo sampling.\n\n5.3. REINFORCE with Baseline\nThe policy gradient theorem can be generalized to include a comparison of the action value to an arbitrary baseline b(s):\n\n\\nabla J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\propto \\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a}\\left(q_{\\pi}(s, a)-b(s)\\right) \\nabla \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n\nsince the baseline can be any function, even a random variable, as long as it does not vary with a\n\n\\sum_{a} b(s) \\nabla \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=b(s) \\nabla \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=b(s) \\nabla 1=0\n\nThe policy gradient theorem with baseline can be used to derive an update rule using similar steps as in the previous section. The update rule that we end up with is a new version of REINFORCE that includes a general baseline:\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} \\doteq \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(G_{t}-b\\left(S_{t}\\right)\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}\n\nBecause the baseline could be uniformly zero, this update is a strict generalization of REINFORCE. In general, the baseline leaves the expected value of the update unchanged, but it can have a large effect on its variance. For example, in the bandit algorithms the baseline was just a number (the average of the rewards seen so far), but for MDPs the baseline should vary with state. In some states all actions have high values and we need a high baseline to differentiate the higher valued actions from the less highly valued ones; in other states all actions will have low values and a low baseline is appropriate.\nOne natural choice for the baseline is an estimate of the state value, \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right), where \\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m} is a weight vector learned by one of the methods presented in previous chapters.\n5.4. Actor–Critic Methods\nAlthough the REINFORCE-with-baseline method learns both a policy and a state-value function, we do not consider it to be an actor–critic method because its state-value function is used only as a baseline, not as a critic. That is, it is not used for bootstrapping (updating the value estimate for a state from the estimated values of subsequent states), but only as a baseline for the state whose estimate is being updated. This is a useful distinction, for only through bootstrapping do we introduce bias and an asymptotic dependence on the quality of the function approximation. As we have seen, the bias introduced through bootstrapping and reliance on the state representation is often beneficial because it reduces variance and accelerates learning. REINFORCE with baseline is unbiased and will converge asymptotically to a local minimum, but like all Monte Carlo methods it tends to learn slowly (produce estimates of high variance) and to be inconvenient to implement online or for continuing problems. As we have seen earlier in this book, with temporal-difference methods we can eliminate these inconveniences, and through multi-step methods we can flexibly choose the degree of bootstrapping. In order to gain these advantages in the case of policy gradient methods we use actor–critic methods with a bootstrapping critic.\nFirst consider one-step actor–critic methods. The main appeal of one-step methods is that they are fully online and incremental, yet avoid the complexities of eligibility traces.\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} & \\doteq \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(G_{t: t+1}-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)} \\\\ &=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha\\left(R_{t+1}+\\gamma \\hat{v}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)-\\hat{v}\\left(S_{t}, \\mathbf{w}\\right)\\right) \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)} \\\\ &=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}+\\alpha \\delta_{t} \\frac{\\nabla \\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)}{\\pi\\left(A_{t}\\; | \\; S_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\right)} \\end{aligned}\n\nThe natural state-value-function learning method to pair with this is semi-gradient TD(0). The pseudocode is shown below.\n\nThe generalizations to the forward view of n-step methods and then to a \\lambda-return algorithm are straightforward.\n\n5.5. Policy Gradient for Continuing Problems\nAs discussed previously, for continuing problems without episode boundaries we need to define performance in terms of the average rate of reward per time step:\n\n\\begin{aligned} J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\doteq r(\\pi) & \\doteq \\lim _{h \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{t=1}^{h} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t} | S_{0}, A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right] \\\\ &=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t} | S_{0}, A_{0: t-1} \\sim \\pi\\right] \\\\ &=\\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s) \\sum_{s^{\\prime}, r} p\\left(s^{\\prime}, r | s, a\\right) r \\end{aligned}\n\nwhere \\mu is the steady-state distribution under \\pi, \\mu(s) \\doteq \\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left\\{S_{t}=s \\; | \\; A_{0: t} \\sim \\pi\\right\\} which is assumed to exist and to be independent of S_{0} (an ergodicity assumption).\n\n\\sum_{s} \\mu(s) \\sum_{a} \\pi(a | s, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) p\\left(s^{\\prime} | s, a\\right)=\\mu\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right),$ for all $s^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}\n\nNaturally, in the continuing case, we define values, v_{\\pi}(s) \\doteq \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t} | S_{t}=s\\right] and q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\doteq \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[G_{t} | S_{t}=s, A_{t}=a\\right], with respect to the differential return:\n\nG_{t} \\doteq R_{t+1}-r(\\pi)+R_{t+2}-r(\\pi)+R_{t+3}-r(\\pi)+\\cdots\n\nWith these alternate definitions, the policy gradient theorem as given for the episodic case remains true for the continuing case.\n\n"},"notes/TRPO.html":{"url":"notes/TRPO.html","title":"Trust Region Policy Optimization","keywords":"","body":" Trust Region Policy Optimization1.

Summary\n\nTwo features of cryptocurrency mining that are key:\nIt is easy for profit-driven miners to participate in multiple mining pools\nthe dynamic adjustment of mining difficulty required for ensuring a stable block production rate leads to an arms race, creating a negative externality in which each individual’s acquisition of hash rates directly hurts others’ payoffs\n\n\nThe certainty equivalent of joining a mining pool more than doubles that of solo mining\nThe total revenue in crypto-mining stays the same whether two miners join force or not\nWithout friction (without passive hash rate), every active miner owns an equal share of each mining pool, irrelevant to the exact pool size. Pool managers charge zero fees due to Bertrand competition, otherwise one pool manager can cut her fee to steal the entire market.\nAs a result, the folk wisdom in the blockchain community that pools become concentrated for better risk sharing is misguided, as long as miners can freely allocate their hash rates.\n\n\nWith friction, a larger incumbent pool optimally charges a higher fee, which slows its percentage growth relative to smaller pools. Therefore, pool sizes mean-revert endogenously.\nA larger pool has a larger impact on global hash rates and consequently charges a higher fee and accommodates proportionally less active hash rates, reminiscent of traditional oligopolistic models where larger producers charge higher prices and produce less. Consequently, in the long run we expect a relatively decentralized market structure in the global mining industry may sustain and no single pool would grow too dominant.\n\n\nThe global hash rates is much higher for multiple mining pools, compared to solo mining mode. As expected, the homogeneous two-pool equilibrium generates lower global hash rates compared to the full risk-sharing equilibrium. Intuitively, pool managers with some market power take into account the arms race effect and hence discourage active miners’ hash rate acquisition by raising their fees. Even when we give the best chance of this market-power force to produce a countervailing effect by considering the lowest possible of number of pools (here, M = 2), quantitatively there is no big difference from the full risk-sharing case. The takeaway is that no matter whether we consider the friction of passive mining, the emergence of mining pools as a form of financial innovation escalates the mining arms race and contributes to its explosive growth in energy consumption in recent years.\n\n1.1. Model\nTechnology rules that for all practical purposes the probability of finding a solution is not affected by the number of trials attempted. This well-known memoryless property implies that the event of finding a solution is captured by a Poisson process with the arrival rate proportional to a miner’s share of hash rates globally. Given a unit hash cost $c$ and a dollar award R for each block, the payoff to a miner who has a hash rate of \\lambda_A operating over a period T is\n\nX_{solo} - c \\lambda_A T, \\text{ where } X_{solo} = B_{solo} R, \\; \\; B_{solo} \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson} \\left(\\frac{1}{D} \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\Lambda} T\\right).\n\nHere, B_{solo} is the number of blocks the miner finds within T—a Poisson distributed random variable capturing the risk that a miner faces in this mining game; \\Lambda denotes global hash rate (i.e., the sum of hash rates employed by all miners, whether individual or pool); D = 60×10 is a constant so that on average one block is created every 10 minutes.\nThe payoff to a participating miner with hash rate \\lambda_A who joins a pool with existing hash rate \\Lambda_B is\n\nX_{pool} - c \\lambda_A T, \\text{ where } X_{pool} = \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\lambda_A + \\Lambda_B} B_{pool} R, \\; \\; B_{pool} \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson} \\left(\\frac{1}{D} \\frac{\\lambda_A + \\Lambda_B}{\\Lambda} T\\right).\n\nX_{pool} second-order stochastically dominates X_{solo}, so any risk-averse miner strictly prefers X_{pool} over X_{solo}.\nThroughout the paper we use preference with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), i.e., exponential utility with risk-aversion parameter \\rho:\n\nu(x) := \\frac{1}{\\rho} (1 - e^{-\\rho x}).\n\n"},"notes/ES_2014_majority.html":{"url":"notes/ES_2014_majority.html","title":"Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable","keywords":"","body":" Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable1.

The honest nodes continue to mine on the public chain, while the pool mines on its own private branch. If the pool discovers more blocks, it develops a longer lead on the public chain, and continues to keep these new blocks private. When the public branch approaches the pool’s private branch in length, the selfish miners reveal blocks from their private chain to the public.\nThis strategy leads honest miners that follow the Bitcoin protocol to waste resources on mining cryptopuzzles that end up serving no purpose. While both honest and selfish parties waste some resources, the honest miners waste proportionally more, and the selfish pool’s rewards exceed its share of the network’s mining power, conferring it a competitive advantage and incentivizing rational miners to join the selfish mining pool.\nAbove a certain threshold size, the revenue of a selfish pool rises superlinearly with pool size above its revenue with the honest strategy.\nThis strategy shows that Bitcoin’s mining algorithm is not incentive compatible.\n\n\n"},"notes/lazy-prices.html":{"url":"notes/lazy-prices.html","title":"Lazy Prices","keywords":"","body":" Lazy Prices1.

Summary\nFor adaptively collected data in a potential outcome model, naive average results in a biased estimation, and the inverse-probability weighting estimator results in a non-normal asymptotic distribution. This paper propose a test statistic that is asymptotically unbiased and normal.\n2. Details\nDenote our data as (W_t, Y_t), The random variables W_{t} \\in \\mathcal{W} are called the arms, treatments or interventions. Arms are categorical. The reward or outcome Y_{t} represents the individual's response to the treatment. The treatment assignment probabilities e_{t}(w):=\\mathbb{P}\\left[W_{t}=w \\mid H^{t-1}\\right], also called propensity scores, are time-varying and decided via some known algorithm. Given this setup, we are concerned with the problem of estimating and testing pre-specified hypotheses about the value of an arm, denoted by Q(w):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{t}(w)\\right], as well as differences between two such values, denoted by \\Delta\\left(w, w^{\\prime}\\right):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{t}(w)\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{t}\\left(w^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]. \nIPW estimator is defined as\n\n\\widehat{Q}_{T}^{I P W}(w):=\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{I P W}(w), \\quad \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{I P W}(w):=\\frac{\\mathbb{I}\\left\\{W_{t}=w\\right\\}}{e_{t}(w)} Y_{t},\n\nand the augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimator is defined as\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\widehat{Q}_{T}^{A I P W}(w):=\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{A I P W}(w) \\\\\n&\\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{A I P W}(w):=\\frac{\\mathbb{I}\\left\\{W_{t}=w\\right\\}}{e_{t}(w)} Y_{t}+\\left(1-\\frac{\\mathbb{I}\\left\\{W_{t}=w\\right\\}}{e_{t}(w)}\\right) \\hat{m}_{t}(w).\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe symbol \\hat{m}_{t}(w) denotes an estimator of the conditional mean function m(w)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{t}(w)\\right] based on the history H^{t-1}, but it need not be a good one: it could be biased or even inconsistent (doubly robust estimator). The second term of \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{A I P W}(w) acts as a control variate: adding it preserves unbiasedness but can reduce variance, as it has mean zero conditional on H^{t-1} and, if \\hat{m}_{t}(w) is a reasonable estimator of m(w), is negatively correlated with the first term.\nInverse-probability weighting fixes the bias problem but results in a non-normal asymptotic distribution. In fact, when the probability of assignment to the arm of interest tends to zero, the inverse probability weights increase, which in turn causes the tails of the distribution to become heavier.\nThis paper considers the adaptively-weighted AIPW estimator:\n\n\\widehat{Q}_{T}^{h}(w)=\\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} h_{t}(w) \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{t}^{A I P W}(w)}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} h_{t}(w)},\n\nwith a sequence of evaluation weights h_t(w).

Summary\nThis paper consider the problem of M-estimators for contextual bandit under the adaptive collected data scheme. Using particular adaptive weights, the M-estimators can be used to construct asymptotically valid confidence regions for a variety of inferential targets.\n2. Settings\nWe assume that the data we have after running a contextual bandit algorithm is comprised of contexts \\left\\{X_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}, actions \\left\\{A_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T}, and primary outcomes \\left\\{Y_{t}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{T} . T is deterministic and known. We use potential outcome notation and let \\left\\{Y_{t}(a): a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\right\\} denote the potential outcomes of the primary outcome and let Y_{t}:=Y_{t}\\left(A_{t}\\right) be the observed outcome. We assume a stochastic contextual bandit environment in which \\left\\{X_{t}, Y_{t}(a): a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\right\\} \\stackrel{i . i . d}{\\sim} \\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathbf{P} for t \\in[1: T].

Adaptively Weighted M-Estimators\nOur proposed estimator for \\theta^*(\\mathcal{P}), \\hat{\\theta}_{T}, is the maximizer of a weighted version of the M-estimation criterion,\n\n\\hat{\\theta}_{T}:=\\underset{\\theta \\in \\Theta}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} W_{t} m_{\\theta}\\left(Y_{t}, X_{t}, A_{t}\\right)=: \\underset{\\theta \\in \\Theta}{\\operatorname{argmax}} M_{T}(\\theta),\n\nwhere \n\nW_{t}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_{t}^{\\text {sta }}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}\\right)}{\\pi_{t}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}, \\mathcal{H}_{t-1}\\right)}}.\n\nHere \\left\\{\\pi_{t}^{\\mathrm{sta}}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1} are pre-specified stabilizing policies that do not depend on data \\left\\{Y_{t}, X_{t}, A_{t}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}. A default choice for the stabilizing policy when the action space is of size |\\mathcal{A}| is just \\pi_{t}^{\\mathrm{sta}}(\\bar{a}, x)=1 /|\\mathcal{A}| for all x, a, t. \nThis weight is very similar to the result in Hadid et al. (2021), where \\pi_{t}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}, \\mathcal{H}_{t-1}\\right) serves as the propensity score and \\pi_{t}^{\\mathrm{sta}}\\left(A_{t}, X_{t}\\right) is basically a constant.\nTo construct uniformly valid confidence regions for \\theta^{*}(\\mathcal{P}) we prove that \\hat{\\theta}_{T} is uniformly asymptotically normal in the following sense:\n\n\\Sigma_{T}(\\mathcal{P})^{-1 / 2} \\ddot{M}_{T}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{T}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{T}-\\theta^{*}(\\mathcal{P})\\right) \\stackrel{D}{\\rightarrow} \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, I_{d}\\right) \\text { uniformly over } \\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathbf{P},\n\nwhere \\ddot{M}_{T}(\\theta):=\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial^{2} \\theta} M_{T}(\\theta) and \\Sigma_{T}(\\mathcal{P}):=\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{P}, \\pi_{t}^{s t a}}\\left[\\dot{m}_{\\theta^{*}(\\mathcal{P})}\\left(Y_{t}, X_{t}, A_{t}\\right)^{\\otimes 2}\\right]. We define \\dot{m}_{\\theta}:=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} m_{\\theta}. Similarly we define respectively \\ddot{m}_{\\theta} and \\dddot{m}_{\\theta} as the second and third partial derivatives of m_{\\theta} with respect to \\theta. For any vector z we define z^{\\otimes 2}:=z z^{\\top}. \nNotice that the basic conditions and intuitions behind these can be traced back to the classical asymptotic results for M-estimator (Van der Vaart.

Summary\n\nNothing-at-stake is one of the downsides of Proof-of-Stake. The problem is that the lack of an explicit cost (compared to Proof-of-Work in Bitcoin) coupled with the explicit benefit of the block reward implies that a validator will always update the ledger whenever given the opportunity even if the update necessarily perpetuates disagreement.\n\nThis paper examines the nothing-at-stake problem using a formal economic analysis. The key results can be summarized as follows:\n\nAdding a block to the shorter branch on the blockchain has two effects for the player appending the block. \n\nThe first effect is that the player receives a block reward in terms of coins on that branch; this first effect creates an incentive for the player to append the block. \nThe second effect is that the value of all coins falls; this second effect competes with the first effect and discourages the player from adding a block to the shorter branch. \n\n\nA myopic player with no coins always appends to the blockchain when given the option if the block reward takes a strictly positive value. Alternatively, a player with a large stake opts not to append to the blockchain when doing so defers consensus due to the prohibitive cost incurred via her stake being devalued. An equilibrium in which all players follow the Longest Chain Rule exists if each player holds a sufficient stake. In this case, the long chain rule strategy also constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium. (second effect dominates)\n\nIf there is no block rewards, then there exists an equilibrium in which each player follows the longest chain rule. In other words, a Proof-of-Stake blockchain obtains consensus without further conditions if the blockchain possesses no block reward. (first effect is eliminated)\nThe Proof-of-Stake does not lead to wealth concentration. In expectation, one's wealth share remains the same.\n\n\n\n"},"notes/green_2019_jfe.html":{"url":"notes/green_2019_jfe.html","title":"Crowdsourced employer reviews and stock returns","keywords":"","body":" Crowdsourced employer reviews and stock returns1.

E.g., one can invoke the function ping of contract  c as follows:\nc.call.value(amount)(bytes4(sha3(\"ping(uint256)\")),n);\n\nwhere the called function is identified by the first 4 bytes of its hashed signature, amount determines how many wei have to be transferred to c, and n is the actual parameter of ping. Remarkably, if a function with the given signature does not exist at address c, then the fallback function of c is executed, instead.\n\nsend is used to transfer ether from the running contract to some recipient r, as in r.send(amount). After the ether has been transferred, send executes the recipient’s fallback.\n\ndelegatecall is quite similar to call, with the difference that the invocation of the called function is run in the caller environment. For instance, executing \nc.delegatecall(bytes4(sha3(\"ping(uint256)\")),n)\n\nif ping contains the variable this, it refers to the caller’s address and not to c, and in case of ether transfer to some recipient d — via d.send(amount) — the ether is taken from the caller balance.\n\nbesides the primitives above, one can also use a direct call as follows:\ncontract Alice { function ping(uint) returns (uint) }\ncontract Bob   { function pong(Alice c){ c.ping(42); } }\n\nThe first line declares the interface of Alice’s contract, and the last two lines contain Bob’s contract: therein, pong invokes Alice’s ping via a direct call. Now, if the programmer mistypes the interface of contract Alice (e.g., by declaring the type of the parameter as int, instead of uint), and Alice has no function with that signature, then the call to ping actually results in a call to Alice’s fallback function.\n\n\nHere is a list of vulnerabilities\n\nException disorder. In Solidity there are several situations where an excep- tion may be raised, e.g. if (i) the execution runs out of gas; (ii) the call stack reaches its limit; (iii) the command throw is executed. However, Solidity is not uniform in the way it handles exceptions: there are two different behaviours, which depend on how contracts call each others.\nif every element of the chain is a direct call, then the execution stops, and every side effect (including transfers of ether) is reverted. Further, all the gas allocated by the originating transaction is consumed;\nif at least one element of the chain is a call (the cases delegatecall and send are similar), then the exception is propagated along the chain, reverting all the side effects in the called contracts, until it reaches a call. From that point the execution is resumed, with the call returning false10. Further, all the gas allocated by the call is call.\n\n\nGasless send. When using the function send to transfer ether to a contract, it is possible to incur in an out-of-gas exception. This may be quite unex- pected by programmers, because transferring ether is not generally associated to executing code.\nType casts. The Solidity compiler can detects some type errors.\nReentrancy. The fallback mechanism may allow an attacker to re-enter the caller function. This may result in unexpected behaviours, and possibly also in loops of invoca- tions which eventually consume all the gas.\nKeeping secrets. Declaring a field as private does not guarantee its secrecy. This is because, to set the value of a field, users must send a suitable transaction to miners, who will then publish it on the blockchain. Since the blockchain is public, everyone can inspect the contents of the transaction, and infer the new value of the field.\nImmutable bugs. Once a contract is published on the blockchain, it can no longer be altered. \nStack size limit. Each time a contract invokes another contract (or even itself via `this.f()) the call stack associated with the transaction grows by one frame. The call stack is bounded to 1024 frames: when this limit is reached, a further invocation throws an exception.\n\n"},"notes/Lee_2019_jfe.html":{"url":"notes/Lee_2019_jfe.html","title":"Technological Links and Predictable Returns","keywords":"","body":" Technological Links and Predictable Returns1.

Summary\nThis paper studies the crowdsourced stock ranking data from Forcerank. It shows that investors extrapolate from stocks’ recent past returns, with more weight on more recent returns, es- pecially when recent returns are negative, salient, or from a dispersed cross-section. Such extrapolative beliefs are stronger among nonprofessionals and large stocks.\n\nRegression using consensus Forcerank score as the dependent variable and past stock returns as the explanatory variables. \n\nThe coefficients on the past 12 weekly returns are all positive and mostly significant. More important, the coefficients on recent past returns are in general higher than those on distant past returns.\nThey further decompose past weekly returns into their systematic and idiosyncratic components using the CAPM. The results show that investors extrapolate only from past idiosyncratic returns.\n\n\nWe have observed a clear and robust decay pattern in the relation between investors’ current return expec- tation and recent past returns. To capture this pattern parsimoniously, we now estimate a parametric regression model that assumes an exponential decay of weights on past returns:\n\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  &\\text { Forcerank }_{i, t}=\\lambda_{0}+\\lambda_{1} \\cdot \\sum_{s=0}^{n} w_{s} R_{i, t-s}+\\varepsilon_{i, t} \\\\\n  &\\text { where } w_{s}=\\frac{\\lambda_{2}^{s}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\lambda_{2}^{j}}.\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \n\n\n\nThe first parameter, \\lambda_1—a scaling factor that multiplies all past returns of stock i—captures a “level” effect (i.e., the overall extent to which investor expectations respond to these past returns). The second parameter, \\lambda_2— which governs how past returns are relatively weighted in forming expectations—captures a “slope” effect: a \\lambda_2 closer to zero means that investors put much higher weight on recent past returns as opposed to distant past returns. \n\nThe parametric regression reports an estimate of 34.12 for \\lambda_{1} and an estimate of 0.55 for \\lambda_{2}. These joint estimates suggest that Forcerank participants exhibit a strong degree of extrapolation. \n\nInterestingly, between professional and nonprofessional users, the extrapolation parameters are quite different. We find that financial professionals have a \\lambda_{1} of 26.35, which is lower than that of the nonprofessionals (33.77), suggesting that professionals rely less on past stock returns when forming expectations about stock returns over the next week. Moreover, professionals have a \\lambda_{2} of 0.773, which is higher than that of the nonprofessionals (0.552).\n\n\nTo develop a deeper understanding of expectation formation, we generalize the parametric regression by separately estimating \\lambda_{1} and \\lambda_{2} for past returns of different characteristics. \n\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\text { Forcerank }_{i, t}=& \\lambda_{0}+\\lambda_{1, p} \\cdot \\sum_{s=0}^{n} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{R_{i, t-s} \\geq 0\\right\\}} \\cdot w_{s, p} R_{i, t-s} +\\lambda_{1, n} \\cdot \\sum_{s=0}^{n} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{R_{i, t-s}\nwhere w_{s, p}=\\frac{\\lambda_{2, p}^{s}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\lambda_{2, p}^{j}} and w_{s, n}=\\frac{\\lambda_{2, n}^{s}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\lambda_{2, n}^{j}}.\n\nThe results show that return extrapolation is asymmetric. In particular, individuals seem to put more weight on negative past returns -\\lambda_{1, n} is much larger than \\lambda_{1, p}-and this weight decays more slowly into the past for negative past returns - \\lambda_{2, n} is much higher than \\lambda_{2, p} and is therefore much closer to one. \n\n\nTo understand the source of the return predictability, we further decompose the Forcerank score into two components: a predicted score and the residual. The predicted score is computed as the fitted value from the nonlinear regression. Then we run regressions where future returns is Y and these scores are the explanatory variables.\n\nForcerank score and the predicted score both drive out past-return measures when they are included in the same regression.\nBy construction, the residual score is orthogonal to past returns. Interestingly, regressions show that the residual score also negatively predicts the next week’s return, with or without controlling for past returns. This finding suggests that the predictive power of the Forcerank score is not completely driven by its association with past returns. \nA large literature on the short-term return reversal has already shown that the past return of a stock negatively predicts its future return and this reversal can be driven by liquidity shocks unrelated to return extrapolation (see Jegadeesh and Titman, 1995 and Campbell et al., 1993, among others). A priori, we do not expect liquidity shocks to be the main explanation for return predictability because stocks in our sample tend to be very large stocks.\nTo evaluate the economic significance of our return predictability results, we form trading strategies. At the beginning of each week, we sort the stocks into five quintiles based on different variables. The portfolio is rebalanced every week. Stocks with prices below $5 at the beginning of the week are removed to reduce the impact of illiquidity.\nThe low-score-minus-high-score re- turn spread is 8.11 bps per day (t-value of 2.33). The return spread remains significant after risk adjustments using the CAPM, the Fama-French five-factor model, or the five-factor model augmented with the momentum factor and the short-term reversal factor.\n\n\n\n​        \n"},"notes/Parsons_2020_rfs.html":{"url":"notes/Parsons_2020_rfs.html","title":"Geographic Lead-Lag Effects","keywords":"","body":" Geographic Lead-Lag Effects1.

We use a one month horizon both for the sorting criterion (i.e., area-level stock returns are measured over a month) as well as the holding period (i.e., portfolios are reformed at the end of every month). Based on these rankings, we form value-weighted portfolios.\nLocation beyond firm headquarters: the question we explore is whether regional predictability is stronger for more regionally concentrated firms (e.g., AutoDesk) compared to those with a more disperse presence (e.g., Whole Foods). \nTo obtain a more general measure of a firm’s geographical presence, Garcia and Norli (2012) utilize a text-based parsing algorithm that counts the number of unique state names mentioned in the annual reports of publicly traded firms from 1994-2008.\nIn all cases, the point estimates for the more regionally concentrated firms are somewhat larger compared to their less concentrated counterparts.\n\n\n\n"},"notes/Ali_2020_jfe.html":{"url":"notes/Ali_2020_jfe.html","title":"Shared Analyst Coverage: Unifying Momentum Spillover Effects","keywords":"","body":" Shared Analyst Coverage: Unifying Momentum Spillover Effects1.
