The Use and Usefulness of Big Data in Finance: Evidence from Financial Analysts</h2>
<h3 id="1-overview-and-research-motivation"><a name="1-overview-and-research-motivation" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#1-overview-and-research-motivation"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.1. 1. Overview and Research Motivation</h3>
<p>The paper examines the role of alternative (or &#x201C;big&#x201D;) data in the finance industry, particularly how sell&#x2010;side analysts incorporate such data into their research reports and the subsequent impact on their performance. Traditionally, analysts rely on standard financial and operational data to produce forecasts and recommendations. However, as modern information technologies have enabled the collection and analysis of vast &#x201C;alternative&#x201D; data&#x2014;ranging from satellite imagery to web traffic and sentiment analysis&#x2014;the paper asks whether analysts&#x2019; adoption of these novel datasets helps them generate more accurate earnings forecasts and adds value for investors through enhanced trading outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="2-data-and-methodology"><a name="2-data-and-methodology" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#2-data-and-methodology"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.2. 2. Data and Methodology</h3>
<p><strong>Data Sources and Sample:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The authors constructed a unique dataset by collecting 64,018 written research reports on firms in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) between 2009 and 2019.</li>
<li>These reports come from 1,002 analysts working at 55 brokerage firms, and the study matches these reports with corresponding annual earnings forecasts from the IBES database.</li>
<li>In addition, the study uses institutional investor trade data (from ANcerno) to link analyst research to trading commission outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Textual Analysis Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The paper employs an iterative keyword-based textual analysis to detect explicit mentions of alternative data usage in analysts&#x2019; reports.</li>
<li>To do this, the authors first compile names of in-house data science teams and external alternative data vendors from industry sources.</li>
<li>They then expand the keyword list by extracting terms that analysts use when describing alternative data insights (e.g., &#x201C;satellite image,&#x201D; &#x201C;web traffic,&#x201D; &#x201C;point-of-sale&#x201D;).</li>
<li>This process allowed the authors to classify alternative data into eight distinct categories: app usage, sentiment, employee data, geospatial, point-of-sale, satellite image, web traffic, and &#x201C;other&#x201D; data types.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-key-findings"><a name="3-key-findings" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#3-key-findings"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.3. 3. Key Findings</h3>
<p><strong>Increasing Adoption Over Time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a marked rise in the explicit use of alternative data among analysts. For example, while only about 11% of analysts referenced alternative data in reports during the early part of the sample period (2009&#x2013;2010), this proportion grew to 28% by 2018&#x2013;2019.</li>
<li>The study also documents that across the eight categories, all types of alternative data are used&#x2014;with web-traffic data and &#x201C;other&#x201D; types being among the most common.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhanced Forecast Accuracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The authors provide empirical evidence that analysts who explicitly disclose the use of alternative data produce more accurate earnings forecasts.</li>
<li>In a difference-in-differences framework, the improvement in forecast accuracy associated with alternative data usage is economically significant&#x2014;for instance, comparable to having covered the firm for an extra 3.6 years.</li>
<li>This suggests that alternative data can offer unique, forward-looking insights that go beyond traditional information channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economic Value via Trading Commissions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sell-side analysts&#x2019; value is traditionally measured indirectly through the trading commissions their brokerages earn, which are higher when investors trust and follow their research.</li>
<li>The paper finds that reports incorporating alternative data are associated with a significant increase in trading commissions. Specifically, the effect is substantial enough to nearly double the median level of commissions for trades executed after such reports.</li>
<li>This indicates that the market&#x2014;both institutional and retail investors&#x2014;perceives enhanced value when analysts leverage alternative data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on Investor Competition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The analysis shows that the use of alternative data helps level the playing field between hedge funds (traditionally better resourced for advanced data techniques) and other institutional investors (like mutual funds).</li>
<li>When analysts use alternative data, the performance gap in trade returns between hedge funds and non-hedge funds narrows substantially. Retail investor behavior is also affected; they are more likely to align their trades with analyst recommendations when these insights are anchored in alternative data.</li>
</ul>

Discussion: Adoption Hurdles and Broader Implications</h3>
<p><strong>Why Isn&#x2019;t Alternative Data Usage Ubiquitous?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Despite its clear advantages, the paper notes that not every analyst adopts alternative data. The authors explore three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Limitations:</strong> Some firms may lack the in-house expertise or financial resources required to access and process alternative data.</li>
<li><strong>Intermittent Usefulness:</strong> Alternative data might not always generate clear or actionable insights; in many cases, the signals might be too noisy or ambiguous to include in limited report space.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Considerations:</strong> Analysts may choose to withhold certain data-driven insights to maintain a competitive edge or due to concerns about revealing proprietary methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications for the Analyst Profession and Labor Market:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study contributes to the broader literature on technological change in knowledge-intensive fields. Rather than rendering human analysts obsolete, the findings suggest that those who adapt by integrating machine-generated or nontraditional datasets can enhance their performance.</li>
<li>This work underscores the complementary role of human intuition and advanced data analytics in finance&#x2014;hinting at a hybrid future where the best outcomes arise from combining human expertise with big data techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-conclusion"><a name="5-conclusion" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#5-conclusion"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.5. 5. Conclusion</h3>
<p>The paper offers robust evidence that the integration of alternative data into analyst reports is both increasing and economically valuable. By improving earnings forecast accuracy and bolstering the trading commission revenue of brokerages, alternative data serves as a tool to enhance the relevance of sell-side research in a rapidly evolving data landscape. Ultimately, the findings suggest that successful adaptation to new data sources can help mitigate competitive disadvantages in financial markets, benefiting not only analysts and their firms but also a broad spectrum of market participants, from large hedge funds to individual retail investors.</p>

<h3 id="1-research-motivation-and-context"><a name="1-research-motivation-and-context" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#1-research-motivation-and-context"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>2.1. 1. Research Motivation and Context</h3>
<p>The paper explores how managers make disclosure decisions when they continuously receive performance&#x2010;related information in real time. Traditionally, research on managerial disclosure has focused on isolated events (for example, a single piece of bad news), but in today&#x2019;s data-rich environment managers receive an ongoing stream of information (such as weekly sales data). The study investigates how real&#x2010;time revenue information&#x2014;derived from transaction-level credit and debit card sales&#x2014;affects managers&#x2019; choices to voluntarily release revenue forecasts and other disclosure, as well as how this information is ultimately reflected in stock prices and insider trading.</p>
<h3 id="2-data-and-methodological-approach"><a name="2-data-and-methodological-approach" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#2-data-and-methodological-approach"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>2.2. 2. Data and Methodological Approach</h3>
<p><strong>Data Source and Sample:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The authors use a proprietary database of 1.6 billion credit and debit card transactions from 2012 through early 2016.</li>
<li>The sample focuses on retail and other consumer-oriented firms where card sales comprise a significant portion of overall revenue.</li>
<li>By matching transaction-level data with firm-level financial information from Compustat and analyst forecasts (from IBES), they are able to construct a detailed, weekly measure of &#x201C;real-time revenue.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constructing Abnormal Revenue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study creates a measure of abnormal real-time revenue (AbnRev) by comparing the cumulative revenue&#x2014;implied by the real-time data&#x2014;against market expectations derived from analyst consensus revenue forecasts.</li>
<li>To account for firm-specific seasonality (for example, how revenue accumulates over a quarter), the authors adjust the raw transaction data using historical intra-quarter patterns.</li>
<li>They then rank the abnormal revenues into quartiles (denoted as AbnRevRank), which helps isolate weeks with notably positive or negative revenue performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Validation and Supplemental Evidence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The abnormal revenue measures are validated in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>They exhibit a strong positive correlation with unexpected future revenue realizations.</li>
<li>They are positively associated with abnormal stock returns, suggesting that the market does not immediately incorporate these real-time signals.</li>
<li>They correlate with management forecast news&#x2014;indicating that when managers update their guidance, it tends to reflect the underlying real-time revenue signals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-key-findings_1"><a name="3-key-findings_1" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#3-key-findings_1"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>2.3. 3. Key Findings</h3>
<p><strong>Disclosure Patterns and Timing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Withholding of Negative News Early in the Quarter:</strong></p>
<p>Managers are less likely to issue a revenue forecast (i.e., voluntary disclosure) when real-time abnormal revenue is negative during the early part of the fiscal quarter. In other words, when firms are performing below market expectations, managers tend to delay disclosure initially.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increased Disclosure as the Quarter Progresses:</strong></p>
<p>As the quarter moves closer to the mandatory earnings announcement, the withholding of negative news diminishes. This change is likely driven by an increase in litigation risk, heightened analyst scrutiny, and the expectation that the impending public revelation will force managers to disclose bad news.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Asymmetry in Disclosure:</strong></p>
<p>The analysis shows that it is primarily the &#x201C;bad news&#x201D; (i.e., weeks with abnormal revenues in the bottom quartile) that is withheld early, whereas there is no significant increase in the voluntary disclosure of good news. This finding is consistent with classic disclosure models where economic incentives lead firms to delay negative information until external disciplinary mechanisms (like investor reaction or legal risk) compel disclosure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market Reaction and Insider Trading:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Delayed Incorporation into Stock Prices:</strong></p>
<p>Although the real-time revenue measure is strongly informative&#x2014;as evidenced by its positive correlation with future abnormal returns&#x2014;the market does not fully and immediately price in the information. The gradual &#x201C;leakage&#x201D; of performance signals over the quarter suggests a dynamic process of information disclosure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Insider Trading Behavior:</strong></p>
<p>The paper documents that in weeks where there is significant abnormally negative real-time revenue and no corresponding public disclosure, insider managers are more likely to sell their shares. This behavior implies that managers might use their private information for personal gain when they choose not to disclose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Role of Disciplinary Mechanisms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The withholding and subsequent release of information are found to be more pronounced in firms characterized by:<ul>
<li><strong>High Analyst Coverage:</strong> Greater monitoring by equity analysts increases pressure on managers to eventually release negative information.</li>
<li><strong>High Institutional Ownership:</strong> With more sophisticated investors monitoring performance, non-disclosure becomes costlier.</li>
<li><strong>High Litigation Risk:</strong> The prospect of legal or reputational consequences forces managers to disclose adverse information as the quarter&#x2019;s end nears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-contributions-and-implications"><a name="4-contributions-and-implications" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#4-contributions-and-implications"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>2.4. 4. Contributions and Implications</h3>
<p><strong>Advances in Disclosure Literature:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The paper contributes to our understanding of dynamic disclosure by quantifying how managers decide on the timing of releasing private performance information under a continuous information flow.</li>
<li>By using alternative &#x201C;big data&#x201D; (i.e., transaction-level sales) rather than traditional financial statements alone, the study provides novel evidence on the informativeness of real-time signals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For investors, the findings highlight that important performance-related information may be privately known by managers and only gradually disclosed, leaving potential opportunities and risks unpriced in the market.</li>
<li>Regulators and analysts should be aware that high-frequency data can offer insights into firms&#x2019; performance trajectories that are not immediately visible through conventional disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Broader Insights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The interplay between real-time performance monitoring and managerial discretion underscores the evolving nature of firm disclosure in an era where digital data is increasingly accessible.</li>
<li>The study illustrates how internal managerial incentives (including personal trading behavior) interact with external pressures (analyst, institutional investor, and litigation threats) to shape the timing and content of disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, &#x201C;Real-time revenue and firm disclosure&#x201D; provides comprehensive evidence that real-time, granular data can reveal meaningful private information about firms&#x2019; performance and that managers strategically time their disclosures based on the nature of the news and the institutional environment in which they operate. The paper&#x2019;s findings have important ramifications for researchers, investors, and regulators interested in the impacts of increasing data transparency on market efficiency.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The paper investigates whether real&#x2010;time proxies for corporate sales&#x2014;derived from alternative data sources such as mobile device activity&#x2014;contain private, economically meaningful information that can predict earnings surprises and stock returns surrounding earnings announcements.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<p>Managers possess up-to-date operational sales data that may not be immediately disclosed in financial reports. By capturing consumer activities in real time, the authors aim to measure two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Within&#x2010;quarter Sales (WQS):</strong> Sales activity during the earnings quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Post&#x2010;quarter Sales (PQS):</strong> Sales activity occurring after quarter-end but before the earnings announcement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-methodology-and-data-construction"><a name="2-methodology-and-data-construction" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#2-methodology-and-data-construction"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>3.2. 2. Methodology and Data Construction</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data Sources:</strong></p>
<p>The authors assemble real-time sales indexes from multiple big&#x2010;data sources&#x2014;including signals from approximately 50 million mobile devices (and other sources like tablet and desktop data). The focus is on U.S. retail firms, where consumer activity is a direct proxy for sales.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Development of Sales Indexes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>WQS (Within&#x2010;quarter Sales Index):</strong></p>
<p>Calculated by taking the log difference between the number of consumer &#x201C;events&#x201D; (e.g., searches for directions, coupon downloads, store visits) aggregated over the current quarter and the average of the prior four quarters. WQS serves as a proxy for the firm&#x2019;s real-time sales growth during the earnings period.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PQS (Post&#x2010;quarter Sales Index):</strong></p>
<p>Computed similarly but for the period between quarter-end and the earnings announcement (typically 4&#x2013;6 weeks later). PQS is intended to capture the private, post&#x2010;quarter performance that managers might know but not immediately communicate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>
<p>These indexes are designed to approximate managerial private information. WQS is expected to closely track realized revenue growth and earnings surprises, whereas PQS gauges information that remains under the public radar until later.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Revenue and Earnings Surprises:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong Correlation with Fundamentals:</strong></p>
<p>The within-quarter index (WQS) is highly predictive of actual quarterly revenue growth. For instance, regressions show that WQS explains up to 39% of the variation in revenue growth.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Earnings Announcement Returns:</strong></p>
<p>Firms that rank high on WQS experience significantly more positive announcement returns compared to those ranking low. In fact, the average announcement return differential across quintiles is around 3.4% (over a five-day event window).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Implication:</strong></p>
<p>WQS encapsulates actionable information as it reflects unannounced sales performance which eventually gets priced in during the earnings announcement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-insights-on-post&#x2010;quarter-information-pqs-and-managerial-disclosure"><a name="4-insights-on-post&#x2010;quarter-information-pqs-and-managerial-disclosure" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#4-insights-on-post&#x2010;quarter-information-pqs-and-managerial-disclosure"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>3.4. 4. Insights on Post&#x2010;quarter Information (PQS) and Managerial Disclosure</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Timely Disclosure vs. &#x201C;Leaning Against the Wind&#x201D; (LAW):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Timely Disclosure Hypothesis:</strong></p>
<p>Posits that managers should fully release their private post-quarter information at the time of the earnings announcement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>LAW Alternative:</strong></p>
<p>Suggests that managers deliberately understate or bias their disclosures downward&#x2014;especially when they receive positive post&#x2010;quarter information&#x2014;in order to preserve a private information advantage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Empirical Evidence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Announcement vs. Post&#x2010;announcement Returns:</strong></p>
<p>When controlling for WQS and other fundamentals, PQS is found to be negatively correlated with announcement returns but positively related to returns in the post-announcement period. This indicates that while some information is signaled at announcement, a portion of it is withheld and only gradually incorporated into the stock price.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Direct Disclosure Channels:</strong></p>
<p>Analysis of management forecasts (bundled with earnings announcements) and conference call tone shows that managers issue pessimistic guidance and adopt a more negative tone when PQS is high. In contrast, discretionary accruals do not show a significant relation with PQS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Asymmetry and Insider Trading:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Asymmetric Disclosure:</strong></p>
<p>The distortion in disclosures is predominantly observed when PQS is positive. Managers tend to &#x201C;lean against the wind&#x201D; by understating good news while not significantly understating bad news.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Insider Trading Evidence:</strong></p>
<p>Further, the negative relationship between PQS and announcement returns is more pronounced when insiders (corporate managers) subsequently purchase stock. This suggests that managers&#x2019; under-disclosure of positive post-quarter information may be driven, in part, by personal trading motivations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Predictive Value of Real-Time Sales Data:</strong></p>
<p>The study confirms that real-time corporate sales measures, particularly WQS, are powerful predictors of both revenue and earnings surprises and have a material impact on announcement returns.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Managerial Disclosure Behavior:</strong></p>
<p>The behavior captured by the PQS measure indicates that managers do not fully disclose all privately held post-quarter performance information at the earnings announcement. Instead, they understate positive signals&#x2014;resulting in lower-than-expected announcement returns and delayed price adjustments in the post-announcement period.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Practical Significance:</strong></p>
<p>These findings suggest that (a) real-time sales data provide a valuable informational edge in understanding firm performance; (b) market participants might benefit from monitoring such alternative data streams; and (c) managerial incentives&#x2014;potentially driven by personal trading motives&#x2014;can lead to systematic disclosure biases that affect stock prices.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The paper proposes a novel, machine-learning&#x2013;based approach to assess borrowers&#x2019; creditworthiness in consumer credit markets by analyzing real-time video data recorded during the loan application process. Traditional credit evaluation methods often rely on historical data (such as credit bureau scores or past financial behavior) that may not accurately capture a borrower&#x2019;s current financial condition. By contrast, real-time video analysis of borrowers&#x2019; facial expressions offers an innovative way to evaluate credit risk instantly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Importance for Financial Inclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Given that billions of adults&#x2014;especially in developing countries&#x2014;lack traditional credit history, fintech lenders are turning to alternative data sources to evaluate creditworthiness. The approach aims to reduce information asymmetries and expand access to credit by capturing subtle, unconscious emotional signals that are difficult to fake, such as micro facial expressions.</p>

<p>The study uses a proprietary video database provided by a leading fintech company in China. The dataset comprises video clips recorded during the loan application process. Out of over 230,000 videos available, a random sample of 10,521 loan application videos is utilized. Among these, 4,956 applications are approved, enabling the authors to link facial expression data to subsequent loan repayment outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Video Analysis Framework:</strong></p>
<p>The researchers employ a state-of-the-art facial analysis toolkit (OpenFace 2.0) to process the video data. The process involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Dividing video clips into frames, enhancing image quality, and identifying the applicant (typically the person at the center of the first frame).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Facial Landmark Detection and Feature Engineering:</strong> Using convolutional experts and support vector machines to detect facial action units (AUs) as defined under the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). These AUs indicate specific muscle movements associated with different expressions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Expression Evaluation:</strong> Focusing primarily on two expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Happiness:</strong> Measured as the difference in the proportion of frames that exhibit happy expressions (e.g., characterized by the simultaneous appearance of AU6 and AU12) versus sad expressions. This differential is meant to capture the applicant&#x2019;s positive affect.</li>
<li><strong>Fear:</strong> Measured as the proportion of video frames in which the applicant shows fear-related expressions (through a specific combination of AUs such as AU1, AU2, AU4, AU5, AU7, AU20, etc.). Only micro facial expressions, which occur in very short windows (half a second or less), are retained to ensure the signals captured are subconscious and hard to manipulate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Variable Construction:</strong></p>
<p>The derived metrics for facial expressions (Happiness and Fear) are computed based on the video frames captured before the loan approval decision is made. These metrics are later transformed (using a logarithmic transformation) to mitigate the influence of outliers in regression analyses.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Outcome Measures:</strong></p>
<p>The primary outcome is <strong>loan delinquency</strong>, defined as an indicator variable that equals one if a borrower fails to make a repayment within 90 days after the due date, and zero otherwise. Additional measures of delinquency (such as delinquency frequency, delinquency value, and a one-month delinquency indicator) are also constructed to test the robustness of the findings.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Happiness Expression &#x2013; Income Adequacy Channel:</strong></p>
<p>Drawing from psychological and economic literature, the authors hypothesize that a higher degree of spontaneous happiness (as captured by micro facial expressions) signals a borrower&#x2019;s well-being and higher expected future income. Thus, borrowers who display more happiness are presumed to have a greater capacity to meet loan repayments, lowering delinquency risk.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fear Expression &#x2013; Income Uncertainty Channel:</strong></p>
<p>Conversely, an increase in fear-related expressions is thought to reflect uncertainty regarding future financial prospects. Fear is interpreted as a marker of uncertainty and risk, suggesting that borrowers exhibiting more fear are likely experiencing higher income volatility and, hence, face a higher probability of delinquency.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Model:</strong></p>
<p>A simple theoretical model is presented where a borrower&#x2019;s future income is assumed to be normally distributed. The model mathematically links higher expected income (associated with happiness) to lower delinquency risk and higher income uncertainty (associated with fear) to higher delinquency risk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-empirical-analysis-and-main-findings"><a name="4-empirical-analysis-and-main-findings" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#4-empirical-analysis-and-main-findings"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>4.4. 4. Empirical Analysis and Main Findings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Main Regression Results:</strong></p>
<p>Logistic regression models are used to predict the likelihood of loan delinquency based on the facial expression metrics. The key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Negative Association of Happiness:</strong></p>
<p>The coefficient on the Happiness metric is significantly negative. This indicates that borrowers who exhibit a relatively higher level of happiness compared to sadness during the application process are less likely to become delinquent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Association of Fear:</strong></p>
<p>The Fear metric is significantly positively associated with loan delinquency. Borrowers who display a higher proportion of fear expression are more likely to fail in meeting their repayment obligations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Incremental Discriminatory Power:</strong></p>
<p>When facial expression metrics are added to a baseline model that includes the lender&#x2019;s internal credit score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) increases by about 2.2 percentage points&#x2014;from 60.5% to approximately 62.7%. This improvement is statistically significant and indicates that micro facial expressions provide additional predictive power beyond traditional credit metrics.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Robustness and Out-of-Sample Validity:</strong></p>
<p>The authors conduct extensive robustness checks using alternative measures of facial expressions (e.g., using full video data, extreme values, and post-approval video segments) and alternative delinquency definitions. Results are consistent across these variations, and out-of-sample tests (e.g., using cross-validation) confirm that the improvements in predictive accuracy are not driven by overfitting.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Heterogeneity Analyses:</strong></p>
<p>Additional tests explore whether the effects vary by borrower gender, time of application (day vs. night), and regional differences (cross-province analyses). The main conclusions remain robust across these subgroups. For example, the negative impact of happiness on delinquency is stronger among borrowers with less financial support from their family, and the positive impact of fear is stronger among those with weaker insurance protections.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Loan Approval Process:</strong></p>
<p>The study also examines whether the fintech lender already uses facial expression data in its loan screening process. The analysis finds no evidence that the lender&#x2019;s approval decision is influenced by applicants&#x2019; real-time facial expressions, suggesting that the video data provides new, untapped information that could further refine credit risk assessment in future applications.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Practical Implications for Fintech Lenders:</strong></p>
<p>The findings suggest that real-time video analysis of micro facial expressions can serve as an innovative complement to traditional credit evaluation methods. By incorporating these cues, lenders can more accurately gauge a borrower&#x2019;s financial well-being (via happiness) and uncertainty (via fear), thereby improving the prediction of loan delinquency risk.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Implications for Financial Inclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The approach holds significant promise for expanding access to credit in markets where traditional credit histories are limited. The use of alternative data like video analysis can reduce information asymmetries and help include previously underserved populations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Overall Contribution:</strong></p>
<p>This study advances the literature by demonstrating that subtle, automatically recorded facial signals can have significant predictive power regarding future credit performance. The integration of machine-learning techniques with real-time behavioral data offers a new avenue for risk assessment and could lead to more efficient and inclusive credit markets.</p>

<h3 id="1-introduction-and-motivation"><a name="1-introduction-and-motivation" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#1-introduction-and-motivation"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>5.1. 1. Introduction and Motivation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The paper aims to develop a statistical factor model that can generate cross&#x2010;sectional company valuation comparisons over a large universe of U.S. publicly traded companies. Accurate valuation is fundamental both for value investing and for guiding internal corporate decisions (e.g., market timing, capital structure adjustments).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Valuation Challenge:</strong></p>
<p>Traditional valuation methods&#x2014;such as discounted cash flow models&#x2014;require detailed projections of cash flows and risk that vary widely between firms. In practice, analysts often use simple valuation multiples (e.g., price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios) within comparable groups. However, these multiples are not easily generalizable across a broad set of companies because of scale effects and differences in firm characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Proposed Approach:</strong></p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a factor model that transforms raw company market values into a scale&#x2010;free, relative value metric by scaling market value by book capital. This relative value ratio, expressed in logarithmic terms, serves as the dependent variable in the model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-model-construction-and-methodology"><a name="2-model-construction-and-methodology" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#2-model-construction-and-methodology"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>5.2. 2. Model Construction and Methodology</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Relative Value Metric:</strong></p>
<p>The paper defines the company&#x2019;s relative value as:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
  q = \ln\left(\frac{MV}{TA}\right)
  </script>
where MV is the market value of the company (constructed from total assets adjusted by replacing book equity with market capitalization for the common stock component) and TA is total assets. This formulation removes scale effects and generates a cross-sectionally comparable measure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Descriptors and Factor Formation:</strong></p>
<p>The authors collect 23 descriptive measures (or &#x201C;descriptors&#x201D;) of firm characteristics covering eight broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong> e.g., realized return on assets (RoA) and analyst forecast RoA.</li>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> e.g., long-term growth (LTG) forecasts, one-year and five-year historical growth rates.</li>
<li><strong>Investment:</strong> e.g., capital expenditure ratios, R&amp;D spending, retained earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> e.g., working capital ratio, slack ratio, various liquidity ratios, and trading liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Measured by book debt-to-equity ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Captured by the firm&#x2019;s stock beta.</li>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> Usually expressed as the natural logarithm of total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Momentum:</strong> Measured by stock return momentum over six- and 12-month horizons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data and Sample:</strong></p>
<p>The analysis uses monthly data on U.S. companies spanning a 44&#x2011;year period from 1976 to 2019. Companies are selected based on criteria such as positive sales, minimum thresholds of book equity, and market capitalization, resulting in a very large sample (over 785,000 company-month observations from more than 6,600 companies).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Combining Descriptors into Factors:</strong></p>
<p>To address multicollinearity and to improve coverage, the authors combine similar descriptors within each category into single valuation factors. They do this by first standardizing each descriptor (using winsorization and z-score transformation) and then averaging them to form a factor. When multiple descriptors exist within a category, a Bayesian weighted approach is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weights are estimated via a constrained regression (imposing that weights sum to one) with an equal-weighting prior (an extension similar to ridge regression but with a prior equal to equal weights). This Bayesian framework stabilizes the estimates when descriptors are highly correlated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Sectional Regression Framework:</strong></p>
<p>Once the eight factors are constructed, the relative value of each company is modeled through a cross-sectional contemporaneous regression at each date:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
  q_t = G_t d_t + F_t c_t + e_t
  </script>
where:</p>
<ul>
<li>q_t is the vector of standardized logarithmic relative value across companies.</li>
<li>G_t is a matrix of industry dummy variables (based on 49 industry groups from SIC codes) to serve as a local bias correction.</li>
<li>F_t represents the matrix of valuation factors.</li>
<li>c_t contains the cross-sectional slope estimates (i.e., the market pricing of each valuation factor).</li>
<li>e_t is the regression residual that represents the temporary misvaluation (mispricing) of individual companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-key-empirical-findings"><a name="3-key-empirical-findings" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#3-key-empirical-findings"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>5.3. 3. Key Empirical Findings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Explanatory Power:</strong></p>
<p>The factor model is shown to explain a high proportion of the cross-sectional variation in company relative value&#x2014;an average in-sample R&#xB2; of 68%. In out-of-sample tests (by splitting the universe into random halves), the model maintains strong performance with only mild degradation (average R&#xB2; around 65%).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stability Over Time:</strong></p>
<p>The market pricing estimates on the valuation factors are highly stable, exhibiting high serial persistence and low time-series variation. This stability suggests that the model reliably captures the underlying determinants of firm valuation that are consistent over long periods.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Misvaluation and Investment Opportunities:</strong></p>
<p>The regression residuals (e_t) from the model, which capture the deviation of a company&#x2019;s actual relative value from the &#x201C;fair&#x201D; value predicted by the model, are interpreted as temporary mispricing. Portfolios constructed based on decile rankings of these residuals deliver statistically and economically significant abnormal returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a long-short portfolio that goes long on companies with the lowest residuals (undervalued) and short on those with the highest residuals (overvalued) delivers strong performance (annualized returns with high t-statistics).</li>
<li>The residual component appears to be the main driver of the return spread, rather than the &#x201C;fair&#x201D; valuation component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Applications to Corporate Decisions:</strong></p>
<p>The factor model&#x2019;s outputs are useful both for external investment (value investing strategies) and for internal corporate decision-making:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment Perspective:</strong> Investors can use the residuals as signals to identify misvaluation and exploit reversion in stock prices.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Decision-Making:</strong> Internal management can use the &#x201C;fair&#x201D; versus &#x201C;misvaluation&#x201D; components to guide financing decisions. For instance, companies may adjust their net equity issuance or debt issuance in response to where their current valuation stands relative to the model&#x2019;s fair value estimate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Comparison with Traditional Multiples:</strong></p>
<p>By scaling market value by book capital and controlling for a broad range of firm characteristics, the proposed approach offers a more systematic and generalizable way to compare company valuations than traditional multiples, which are typically only comparable within narrowly defined peer groups.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>For Value Investing:</strong></p>
<p>The statistical factor model provides a robust framework to identify attractive investment opportunities by isolating mispricing (i.e., the residual component) from fair value. Investors can construct portfolios based on these residual signals to achieve superior returns while controlling for known risk factors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For Corporate Finance:</strong></p>
<p>The model offers insights into how firms might time their financing decisions. For example, a company that is overvalued relative to its fair value might choose to issue equity to capture favorable conditions, while undervalued firms might undertake share repurchases or delay equity financing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Methodological Advances:</strong></p>
<p>The paper contributes a novel way to fuse structural insights (from theories of residual income and discounted cash flow) with empirical factor-based methods. The Bayesian weighting scheme for combining descriptors and the incorporation of industry dummy variables represent important methodological contributions that enhance the stability and generalizability of the factor model.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Broader Research Impact:</strong></p>
<p>This work provides a foundation for further research into company valuation that can incorporate additional descriptors or alternative statistical techniques (e.g., nonlinear mappings, machine learning enhancements) and extend to other relative valuation multiples such as price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-conclusion_1"><a name="5-conclusion_1" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#5-conclusion_1"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>5.5. 5. Conclusion</h3>
<p>The study develops and validates a comprehensive statistical factor model for company relative valuation using a rich set of firm descriptors. By scaling market value by book capital and systematically accounting for various determinants (profitability, growth, investment, liquidity, leverage, market risk, size, and momentum), the model explains a large portion of the cross-sectional variation in relative value and isolates a misvaluation component that predicts future stock returns. The framework not only aids external investors in identifying mispriced stocks for value investing but also assists internal management in making informed financing decisions. Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the literature on valuation by offering a generalizable and robust approach to assess company value across a broad universe.</p>
